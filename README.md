# Interactive Dashboard of Student Activity Patterns (Demonstration)

This interactive dashboard is modeled on a real-world data product I developed during my tenure at Harvard University. To protect sensitive student information, this public-facing version utilizes realistic simulated data of a fictitious liberal arts college to demonstrate the same core process and analytical capabilities.

The original project solved the challenge of synthesizing disparate data streams (like building access swipes and event check-ins) to provide leadership with actionable intelligence on student engagement. 

This demonstration showcases my end-to-end ability to:

*   **Conceptualize and Build a Data Product:** Taking a business need from an idea to a deployed, interactive tool.
*   **Synthesize and Integrate Data:** Merging different data sources to create a unified and comprehensive view of user behavior.
*   **Develop Dynamic Visualizations:** Building user-friendly tools in R (`Plotly`, `htmlwidgets`) that empower non-technical stakeholders to explore complex data on their own.

The result is a powerful tool that transforms raw, disconnected data into an intuitive platform for strategic decision-making.
