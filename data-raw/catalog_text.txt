\f0\fs24 \cf0 Departments and Programs\
Africana\
The Program in Africana encompasses the study of world making in Africa and its global diaspora. The\
program faculty embrace a progressive interdisciplinary approach, foregrounding Blackness, white\
supremacy, and anti-blackness. Courses emphasize the dynamics of unequal power, the production of culture\
and aesthetics, and the formation of personal and group identity. The program aims to enrich knowledge of\
the peoples of Africa and its global diaspora, whether in conditions of freedom or unfreedom. Students of\
Africana work to understand race as an intersectional concept constituted by gender, sexuality, ability, and\
class, among other social locations, as well as the global movement of ideas, including secular practices,\
intellectual traditions, religion and spirituality, and social formations of African-descended peoples. Africana\
prepares students for a range of careers, including research and teaching, public policy, law, advocacy and\
community work, and artistic production and curation. Effective in 2019-20, the Program in Africana\
superseded the long-established Program in African American Studies.\
The chair of Africana provides a list of courses offered each year. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of\
the program, students should 1) consult regularly with the chair or a faculty advisor to ensure that their\
program has both breadth and depth and 2) devise programs of study approved by the chair or a faculty\
advisor by the fall semester of the junior year.\
Thesis advisors are chosen by each student, in consultation with the chair, according to the subject matter of\
the thesis.\
More information is available on the Africana program website.\

Course Offerings\
AFR 100 Introduction to Africana\
This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the discipline and examines the literature, history, arts,\
material culture, as well as sociological, political, economic, and philosophical perspectives of the experiences\
of people of African descent in the Americas. The course sheds light on the relationship between the past and\
the present in shaping Black world making, especially in the Americas. Four themes guide the direction of\
the course: fragmentation, exclusion, resistance, and community.\

AFHI 105 Africa: Special Topics in African History, 1500-1900\
For many observers, the history of Africa begins with European colonization. What about the period prior to\
colonization? This introductory survey of African history from 1500 to 1900 covers the social, political,\
cultural, and economic life of sub-Saharan peoples. Topics include African kingdoms, the transatlantic and\
the Indian ocean slave trades, the expansion of European power after the abolition of the slave trade, Islamic\
reforms, and the spread of Christianity. The course not only introduces students to a range of historical\
events in the continent, but also highlights how some of these events shaped other parts of the world.\

AFRE 107 Religion, Race, and Resistance: From Black Secularism to Black Power\
This course explores religion's complex and contested influence on over four centuries of changing Black\
freedom struggles in the U.S. context. In particular, this course argues that freethought -- a term that\
encompasses atheism, agnosticism, nonbelief, and religious skepticism, among other epistmologies and\
ontological frameworks -- has provided a powerful yet underconsidered intellectual and philosophical basis\
for historical and contemporary organized Black resistance to white supremacy.\

Atlantic Slave Trade to 1910. Students examine music, orations, letters, poems, essays, slave narratives,\
autobiographies, fiction, and plays by Americans of African descent. The essential questions that shape this\
course include: What is the role of African American literature in the cultural identity and collective struggle\
of Black people? What themes, tropes, and forms connect these texts, authors, and movements into a\
coherent living tradition?\

to the present. Students examine music, orations, letters, poems, essays, autobiographies, fiction, and plays by\
Americans of African descent. The essential questions that shape this course include: What is the role of\
African American literature in the cultural identity and collective struggle of Black people? What themes,\
tropes, and forms connect these texts, authors, and movements into a coherent living tradition? This course is\

This course examines the relationship of culture to politics. It introduces the study of struggles to acquire,\
maintain, or resist power and gives particular attention to the role culture plays in reproducing and\
contesting social divisions of class, race, gender, and sexuality. Lectures and discussion incorporate film,\

AFR 162 White Redemption: Cinema and the Co-optation of African American History\
Since its origins in the early twentieth century, film has debated how to represent black suffering. This course\
examines one aspect of that debate: the persistent themes of white goodness, innocence, and blamelessness in\
films that are allegedly about black history and culture. Historical and cultural topics examined in film\
include the enslavement of Africans, Reconstruction, and the civil rights movement.\

AFR 201 Race, Ethnicity, and Feminist Thought\
This course focuses on race, ethnicity, and national power at their intersections with gender. Acknowledging\
the realities of white supremacy and patriarchy, students develop their understanding of these systemic and\
interlocking oppressions, while exploring the resistance to such oppressions that continues to give rise to\
critical feminist theory. Using a range of transdisciplinary perspectives, students examine the work of BIPOC\
feminist scholars and activists and encounter modes of critical and liberatory theorizing that productively\
challenge notions of what constitutes theory. Additionally, students practice ongoing self-reflection, or\
awareness of their own positionality and the ways it affects their journey through the course.\

AFR 202 Coming of Age While Black\
This course proceeds from the premise that coming of age while Black is fraught with the dangers created by\
a system of anti-black surveillance. Students examine "coming-of-age" memoirs and films that began during\
the era of the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1950s. Typically, the films and memoirs in this sub-genre\
feature a young Black protagonist, often a teen, navigating, sometimes successfully but not always, a world\
defined by intersecting oppressions created by race, class, gender, sexuality, and/or colonial identity.\
Prerequisite(s): a course in Africana or in Rhetoric, Film, and Screen Studies.\

AFSO 221 Sociology of Immigration\
Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Amendments of 1965, the United States has received\
millions of immigrants from virtually every part of the world. The magnitude of these recent immigrant\
flows has reshaped the demography of the nation. But the magnitude of the flows is only part of the story.\
Today\'92s immigrants are extremely diverse, ethnically, culturally, and racially. Students explore sociological\
approaches to immigration as they discuss, debate, analyze, and critique academic, political, and mainstream\
articulations of immigration processes in the United States.\

Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Some texts are drawn from Anglophone\
authors such as Lamming, Anthony, Walcott, Brodber, Danticat, Lovelace, Brathwaite, NourBese (Philip),\
Hopkinson, and Dionne Brand; others, from Francophone and Hispanophone writers, including Guillen,\
Carpentier, Cond\'e9, Chamoiseau, Depestre, Ferr\'e9, Santos-Febres, and Morej\'f3n. The course places each work\
in its historical, political, and anthropological contexts, and introduces students to a number of critical\
theories and methodologies with which to analyze the works, including poststructural, Marxist, Pan-African,\
postcolonial, and feminist. Recommended background: AFR 100 or one 100-level English course.\

in black death, voyeurism, and the destruction of the black body in the new public square. Is it true that\
black lives are more easily taken and black bodies destroyed with less legal consequence than others? What\
are the ways in which black lives do not matter? This course analyzes media coverage and debates on social\

Using the literatures of African and African-descended peoples, this course examines the religionstraditional/\
indigenous, Christian, Islamic, and so-called "syncretic"-from the continent and the diaspora. The\
selected works may represent the religious traditions, rituals, and practices of the Yoruba, Shona, Asante,\
Tswana, as well as African Independent Churches, Rastafari, and followers of Vodun, Santer\'eda, Candombl\'e9,\
and related religions. Students approach texts-novels, short stories, dramas, films and poems-as literary\
productions and not just media to convey information about the religions they represent. This course is also\
attentive to contexts; students examine the sacred symbol systems represented as well as the historical era\
depicted and the literary traditions and cultures that produce them. Recommended background: course\
work in Africana or religious studies.\

AFES 239 Anti-Blackness and the Environment\
This course interrogates the link between anti-Blackness and the environment. It examines how race, power,\
and environmental risk converge to create environmental racism, which disparately impacts Black\
communities. This is a conundrum of the Anthropocene: those who cause the least pollution experience its\
effects the most. Students explore this dynamic while paying attention to how communities fight back and\
demand justice. They also consider the role this dynamic plays in our current climate crisis and what it\
implies for the responsibility and possibilities of repair.\

This course examines the rhetoric of containing black bodies in cinematic and literary narratives. In passing\
narratives light-skinned people move across racial lines supposedly fixed by biology, custom, and law. In\
trespassing narratives black persons enter spaces denoted as white by law or custom. This course calls\
attention to fear, fantasy, punishment, and resistance as ongoing dimensions of race and white supremacy.\

AFMU 249 African American Popular Music\
The history of the twentieth century can be understood in terms of the increasing African-Americanization\
of music in the West. The rapid emergence and dissemination of African American music made possible\
through recording technologies has helped to bring about radical cultural change: it has subverted received\
wisdoms about race, gender, and sexuality, and has fundamentally altered our relationship to time, to our\
bodies, to our most basic cultural priorities. This course explores some crucial moments in the history of this\
African-Americanization of popular music and helps students develop an understanding of the relationship\
between musical sound and cultural practice.\

and multimedia, students learn about the important contributions African Americans have made in the field\
of theater and analyze the development of Black performance onstage. They also examine the social and\
political issues that affected the development of the plays, the theater companies, and the performers\
involved, and they consider how this work developed under the shadow of white supremacy. Students are\
expected to develop critical arguments on the various topics covered in the course and develop their own\

AFEN 255 Black Poetry\
How does the African American poetic tradition specifically contribute to the literary canon of African\
American literature and larger conceptions of American and global literature? This course is both an\
introduction to Black poetics and a deep exploration. The course considers so-called basic questions (e.g.,\
What are Black poetics?) and more sophisticated questions (e.g., How do Black poetics transform the literary\
and cultural landscape?). Students read a variety of authors who maneuver between intra- and inter-racial\
politics, including such canonical authors as Langston Hughes and Nikki Giovanni, and less well-known\
authors such as Jayne Cortez and LL Cool J.\

English, such as The Mwindo Epic and The Sundiata; and those written by Lusophone and Francophone\
authors including B\'e2, Senghor, Liking, Neto, Mahfouz, Ben Jelloun, and Kafunkeno. The course\

AFR 269 Narrating Slavery\
This course examines selected autobiographical writings of ex-slaves; biographical accounts of the lives of\
former slaves written by abolitionists, relatives, or friends; the oral histories of ex-slaves collected in the early\
to mid-twentieth century; and the fiction, poems, and dramas about slaves and slavery (neo-slave narratives)\
of the last hundred years. Students consider these works as interventions in the discourses of freedomreligious,\
political, legal, and psychological-and as examples of a genre foundational to many literary works\
by descendants of Africans in diaspora. The course surveys early works written by slaves themselves, such as\

AFHI 301E African Slavery in the Americas\
Of the millions of immigrants who arrived in North and South America during the colonial period, the\
majority came not from Europe but from Africa. They came not for freedom but as human property, facing a\
lifetime of bondage for themselves and their offspring. Far from being the "peculiar institution" that whites\
in the U.S. South called it, slavery existed throughout the Americas before its abolition in the nineteenth\
century. By reading contemporary scholarship and examining such primary sources as music, letters,\
autobiographies, and material artifacts, students gain a sense of the ways Africans and African Americans\
survived and influenced an institution that sought to deny their humanity.\

AFHI 301Q Rebellion and The Archive: Studying Enslaved People\'92s Resistance\
Through revolts and rebellions, enslaved people fundamentally challenged the social order of plantation\
societies and attempted to bring alternatives into view. This seminar is organized thematically to approach\
key topics and methodological challenges, including the African context of enslaved people\'92s politics, the\
role of rumor and communication networks, and the gendered politics of revolt. Centered on these issues,\
this seminar engages students in writing histories from below, of trying to understand the lives and\
experiences of enslaved people, their practices, strategies, and political ideas, in a context where many\
surviving records are from the perspective of oppressors. Recommended background: prior coursework in\
Africana or history.\

Students examine the social value of Black life both during and after enslavement. They mine contentious\
topics such as welfare caps, compulsory sterilization, abortion access, and the disparate experiences of Black\
mothers in the U.S. healthcare system that have led to maternal death rates twice the national average. The\
course considers both the ordinary experiences of Black women birthing as well as the sensationalized\
experiences of mothers such as activist Erica Garner, athlete Serena Williams, and pop icon Beyonc\'e9.\

This course mines the topic of justice while explicitly focusing on the concept of decolonization. In doing so,\
it identifies various iterations of coloniality, such as colonialism, settler colonialism, and postcolonialism. It\
traces decolonial sentiment through previous anti-colonial and anti-imperial movements. It then examines\
the multiple conceptualizations of decoloniality that are determined to sever colonial ties. In doing so, the\
course allows students to envision decolonial futures.\

An anthropological examination of the relationship among art, power, and politics. What can the artistic\
works of various societies say about their worlds that other creations cannot? What claims can art make about\
the workings of power, and what artistic techniques does power itself employ? Students consider these and\
other questions from a number of different perspectives, including the politics of perception, the place of art\
in modern life, the artistry of terror, the art of protest and propaganda, and the dream of building a beautiful\
regime. Recommended background: familiarity with classical social theory, especially Marx, is encouraged\
but not necessary. Prerequisite(s): one course in Africana, American studies, anthropology, art and visual\
culture, or gender and sexuality studies.\

This seminar examines literary theories that address the representation and construction of race, gender, and\
sexuality, particularly, but not exclusively, theories formulated and articulated by Afra-diasporic women such\
as Spillers, Ogunyemi, Carby, Christian, Cobham, Valerie Smith, Busia, Lubiano, and Davies. Students not\

during the era of Jim Crow. Students view the series and also read some of the white supremacist texts of\
Lovecraft and the revision of those works by Ruff. Students put these fictional representations in historical\
context by reading about and conducting research on some of the major historical, sociological, and\
economic studies about the period. They also listen to music and read some of the literary works of the time.\

AFR 390 Afro-Latinoamerica\
The 500-year presence of Africans and their descendants in the Spanish-speaking world has produced a\
significant body of literature by Blacks and about Blacks. Spanish America was the main destination of the\
African diaspora. Writers of African descent attest to the struggle for freedom and the abolition of slavery as\
well as anti-colonialism. Their literature shows how the participation of Blacks in the wars of Latin American\
independence was a struggle for their emancipation. Afro-Hispanic writers in Spain, the Americas, and Africa\
use their art and ideas to address the postnational migrations of the twenty-first century, a diaspora that has\
not ceased. Recommended background: AFR 100. Only open to juniors and seniors.\

implicit and explicit discussions of racial hierarchies, and how immigrants fit into and challenge existing\
accounts of assimilation and incorporation. They deconstruct the racialization of citizenship status with\
particular attention to how blackness is integral to the immigrant racialization project. Prerequisite(s): INDS\

AFEN 395T African American Literary Issues and Criticism\
This seminar takes as its premise that black literature engages with and reflects parts of the world in which it\

other. They read canonical authors and less well-known figures in an effort to tease out the nuance present in\
this body of work. Each text is paired with another in a form of dialogue. These exchanges are not set, so it is\
up to students to understand how the texts speak to each other. Literary criticism requires us to think\

AFHI S13 Black Montreal\
Few people know of Marie-Joseph Angelique, the Portuguese-born black woman who was convicted of\
setting Montreal on fire in 1734, or of Mr. Edward Packwood who created The Free Lance, the first black\
Canadian newspaper. In fact, Afro-descendants have been either miscounted or merely excluded from official\
Canadian records. This course traces the presence of Afro-descended people in the Great White North by\
walking in the footsteps of Afro-descended trappers, settlers, slaves, engag\'e9s, refugees, artisans, cultivators,\
railroad workers, transient workers (such as porters or entertainers), and domestic workers who marked\

Canadian history. It examines the forces that shaped their experience of invisibility and paved the way for\
black internationalism. It also interrogates the tensions within the diaspora concept as it is confronted with\
erasure (diaspora is also constitutive of diasporic identity and community). Students explore these issues by\
examining a range of sources such as novels, oral histories, newspapers, and film. This course includes a short\
ethnographic and cultural expedition to Montreal.\

AFHI S22 Marronage: Escaping Slavery, Forging Freedom\
In slaveholding societies throughout the Americas, enslaved people escaped bondage and formed fugitive\
communities in swamps, mountains, and at the fringes of plantations. Some societies were modest in\
population and duration; others included thousands and have lasted to the present. Known as marronage,\
this practice represented a challenge to the ruling order and a reminder of possibility to enslaved people\
nearby. This course uses case studies of maroons in Panama, Jamaica, and Brazil to explore this practice of\
resistance, its practitioners' visions of freedom and its contemporary use as metaphor.\

American Studies\
What does it mean to be \'93an American?\'94 How does our understanding of American culture, and our relation\
to it, differ depending on historical context, social position, and the interpretive and ideological perspectives\
we bring to bear? American studies pursues these questions using a variety of interdisciplinary approaches,\
texts, performance, and material culture as points of departure for a wide-ranging exploration of American\
culture. While it focuses on the United States, American studies situates the United States in a wider\
transnational context. In particular, American studies explores the various ways that institutions, values and\
practices shape, maintain, and challenge relations of power. American studies courses are designed to\
elucidate what has been rendered socially invisible.\
Such discussions interrogate realities and discourses that have been deemed natural in order to expose their\
socially contingent character. Through their critical engagement with race, gender, sexuality, social class,\
disability, and other sites of identity, and with their own relation to them, students interrogate the meaning\
of belonging, privilege, and exclusion. Current American studies courses focus on cultural geography and\
cultural politics, borderlands, diasporas, film and media, gender, history, literature, music, performance,\
queer theory, and race theory.\
More information is available on the American Studies department website.\

Why do we play the sports we do? Why are sporting performances socially significant, and how have groups\
and political regimes used this significance to suit their needs? What can teams, players, and brands tell us\
about how we (and others) see the world? Addressing topics from cricket in the Caribbean to boxing in\
Chicago, students reappraise conventional sporting narratives and use sports to analyze the social and\
historical conditions in which they occur. In doing so, students think critically about their own sporting\
experiences and develop a deeper and subtler understanding of the ways that societies make sports and sports\
make societies.\

During the nineteenth century, the United States experienced one of the most dramatic political\

and confronted the forces that shaped a restless nation: slavery, capitalism, patriarchy, expansionism,\
urbanization, industrialization, and total warfare. Whether fighting for recognition or resisting the\
encroaching state, they struggled over the very meaning of American nationhood. The outcome was\
ambiguous; its legacy is still being contested today.\

academy, and how cultural studies provides a lens through which to investigate dynamic American\
identities, institutions, and communities. Of particular concern is how differences such as race, gender, class,\
ethnicity, and sexuality are constructed and expressed in diverse settings, and how they connect to the\
deployment of power.\

AMAN 207 Race, Racism, and Redress\
Recent events in the United States and around the globe have prompted a re-examination of the role of race\
in contemporary life. Since its inception, anthropology has been concerned with questions of human origins,\
diversity, and community. In this course, students examine the origins of racial thought, its transformation\
over time, and the ways race and intersecting identifications shape everyday life. Through ethnographies of\
global cultures, students explore how race takes form and meaning in different contexts. Throughout, they\
learn how to think critically about their own identities and beliefs and engage with strategies for redress.\

environment were rooted in their own struggles for power, environmental history offers an important\
perspective on the nation's social history. Specific topics include Europeans', Africans', and Native\
Americans' competing efforts to shape the colonial environment; the impact and changing understanding of\
disease; the relationship between industrial environments and political power; and the development of\
environmental movements.\

AMST 214 Election! Religion, Race, and American Politics\
America is a nation that prides itself on religious diversity but has been deeply shaped by Christianity.\
Americans claim to support a separation of church and state but also call the United States a Christian\
nation. In light of the 2016 presidential election, understanding these tensions is crucial. This course\
examines religious and political issues that will shape the 2016 election while grounding contemporary\
debates in their historical context. Students analyze speeches, debates, court cases, and visual and popular\
culture sources as well as scholarly articles on how religion and politics shape each other. Assignments\
include a community-engaged learning project. Recommended background: familiarity with American\
history, 18th century to the present.\

AMST 216 Indigenous American Photography\
The practice of photography has a complicated history with regards to Indigenous American communities\
and cultures. The extensive photographs of Indigenous Americans created by Edward Curtis even now hold\
sway over America\'92s collective imaging of Indigenous American culture. And yet the late twentieth and early\
twenty-first centuries are rich with photographies of Indigenous Americans, representing themselves through\
the medium, new and vibrant ways of seeing, understanding, and representing Indigenous American\
cultures and histories. In this course, we begin with an overview study of how the process of colonization\
(specifically as it occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the era after the invention of\
photography), deployed the camera and photography to assert discursive control over Indigenous Americans.\
From that painful history, we move into study of the later twentieth century and early twenty-first century\
studying lens-based photographic and filmic works of contemporary Indigenous American artists. The goal\
of the course is to explore and better understand how the photographic image, as leveraged by Indigenous\
Americans, redresses and decolonizes the social landscape of our United States, and to honor the art works of\
these photographers.\

AMEN 219 Reconstruction Then and Now\
In the present moment of enormous unrest and upheaval, this course revisits another: Reconstruction, the\
period of political and cultural rebuilding that followed the end of slavery. Students consider Reconstruction\
not only as a moment of unprecedented historical change, but also as a narrative problem. How did writers\
and filmmakers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century represent the momentous shift from\
slavery to freedom? How were conventional genres and formal strategies - from romance to tragedy and from\
marriage plots to flashbacks - used to tell wildly divergent stories about this contentious period in U.S.\
history? And how have more recent writers and filmmakers taken up what often seems the unfinished\
business of Reconstruction? Prerequisite(s): one English course.\

AMAN 222 Archaeology and Colonial Entanglements in North America\
An introduction to the archaeology of North America throughout the past 20,000 years and earlier. Students\
examine current archaeological hypotheses of the "peopling of the Americas," and construct the most likely\
model based on their command of the literature and an independent critical analysis supporting their own\
hypothesis. Students review and reconcile the archaeological past with indigenous concepts such as oral\
histories and origin stories, challenging and expanding their world view to include non-Western concepts.\
The course applies critical theory perspectives, including indigenous-feminist and postcolonial theories, to\
assess the colonial process that archaeology has at times unwittingly imposed on North American native\
peoples.\

black lives are more easily taken and black bodies destroyed with less legal consequence than others? What\
are the ways in which black lives do not matter? This course analyzes media coverage and debates on social\
media about black death. Students place these discussions in conversation with the critique of race and\

colonization. By looking at the ways various First Nations took advantage of and suffered from their new\
relations with newcomers, students learn that this history is more than one of conquest and disappearance.\
In addition, they learn that the basic categories of "Indian" and "white" are themselves inadequate for\
understanding native pasts and presents. Much of this learning depends on careful readings of Indigenous\
American writers.\

orientation, gender, race, and political affiliation affected how people "breathe free" and navigated the US\

American economy alike, and the contemporary reverberations thereof. Finally, they examine phenomena\
such as the radical right, the progressive movement, rural underdevelopment, the declining American\
middle class, welfare reform, and competition for global economic dominance.\

residue of "social change" while not forgetting the problematization of the aesthetic. They consider U.S.-\
based interdisciplinary artists such as Thiong'o, Fusco, Ana Mediata, Tania Bruguera, David Hammon, Jay-Z,\
Pope.L, and Lady Gaga with critical theorists such as Fanon, Butler, Foucault, Phalen, Mu\'f1oz, Moten,\

explores how psychology might be transformed in order to realize people\'92s liberatory potential. Topics\
include the ways that psychology has been dehumanized (as Mart\'edn-Bar\'f3 says, psychology "erases the very\
real thing of life that make up what we are as human beings"); how to embed human experiences within the\
historical, sociopolitical, and economic context; and how to place psychology in the service of human\
liberation, especially for those who have hitherto been ignored or relegated to the margins of consideration.\

AMST 395J Frontier and Border in U.S. Literature\
The American "frontier" has long been a controlling idea in the production of U.S. national identity: less\
physical reality than ideological framework, what historian Frederick Jackson Turner called "the meeting\
point between savagery and civilization." Drawing on theoretical and historical writings, studied alongside\
twentieth-century U.S. literary texts, this course examines the history and legacy of this concept, and the new\
interpretive and cultural paradigms of "the border" that have supplanted Turner's "frontier thesis." Studying\
the border as "contact zone," students read widely in Chicana/o and Native American literatures, studying\
connections and commonalities in what are often treated as distinct traditions, toward a more nuanced\
understanding of the diverse territories -- real and imagined -- engaged by critical discourses of the border.\

AMST S10 Art, Activism, and Environmental Racism\
This course combines an emphasis on visual culture with political concerns and ethical theory. We ground\
our study in the work of artists LaToya Ruby Frazier, Will Wilson (Navajo/Din\'e9), Fazal Sheikh, and Alicia\
Grull\'f3n, who deploy photography and performance work to contest the ongoing problem of environmental\
racism in the United States. Students read studies of intersections of racism, economic policy, and pollution\
in the violence that is environmental racism, including texts by Rob Nixon and Dorceta Taylor. Our goal is\
to understand how art conveys lived experiences of environmental racism and also to frame the problematic\
of this pattern of pollution through discussions of ethics and politics.\

Anthropology\
Anthropologists investigate cultural variation, with particular attention to race, gender, ethnicity, political\
and social change, and human evolution. Anthropology is a comprehensive discipline offering students a\
broad, comparative, and essentially interdisciplinary approach to the study of human life in all its diversity.\
Anthropologists are concerned with understanding human universals, on the one hand, and the uniqueness\
of individual cultures, on the other. At Cheltenham the program includes archaeological and sociocultural\
perspectives.\
Anthropology attempts to make sense, in a nonethnocentric manner, of everyday life in both familiar and\
distant settings. In this way the discipline enables students to achieve cultural competence in the broadest\
sense of the term\'97the ability to function effectively in complex environments, to analyze material from their\
own and other cultural perspectives, and to appreciate the value of human diversity. Some recent graduates\
have pursued careers in public health, medicine, community organizing, environmental law, international\
development, teaching, journalism, and museum work; some have gone on to graduate work in\
anthropology or archaeology.\
ANTH 101 and 103 are designed as introductions to the discipline of anthropology and as preparation for\
more advanced courses. Most 200-level courses also admit first-year students, while reflecting a specific field\
within anthropology. The 300- and 400-level courses are open to all upperclass students, but the latter are\
especially designed for majors.\
More information is available on the Anthropology department website.\

Course Offerings\
ANTH 101 Cultural Anthropology\
An introduction to the study of a wide variety of social and cultural phenomena. The argument that the\
reality we inhabit is a cultural construct is explored by examining concepts of race and gender, kinship and\
religion, the individual life cycle, and the nature of community. Course materials consider societies\
throughout the world against the background of the emerging global system and the movement of refugees\
and immigrants.\

Archaeology is anthropology that looks into the past by examining material remains. This course introduces\
the theories, methods, and techniques employed by modern archaeologists. It examines such issues as what is\
left behind, how we find and interpret it, and what it all means to us today. Using hands-on lab exercises,\
films, computer simulations, and field trips, this course reveals dimensions of human culture often not\

ANTH 107 Sensory Anthropology: The Politics and Poetics of Our Senses in the World\
This course considers the senses and sensory perception from a sociocultural perspective. How do our senses\
help us to order and organize our world? How are our senses themselves ordered and organized? In what\
ways might our senses be intertwined with the world in which we live? This course considers these questions\
in a range of different contexts, and it challenges students to think about the senses as socially and culturally\
constructed pathways between bodies and worlds. In doing so, the course directs our attention to the politics\
of the senses: namely, how worlds of perception and experience are opened for us, closed to us, and shaped\
by forces beyond our immediate control.\

humans differently define and experience life, death, illness, wellness, health, sex, and pain throughout the\
world and over time. The course begins with classic texts in medical anthropology and ethnomedicine and\
shifts to more contemporary work in critical medical anthropology. There is a special focus in the course on\
global inequalities in health and medicine, on cross-cultural perspectives on pain and suffering, and on\
understanding biomedicine as a cultural system.\

including colonialism, resistance and domination, race, and gender. Students consider questions such as:\
Why do we play the sports we do? Why are sporting performances socially significant, and how have groups\
and political regimes used this significance to suit their needs? What can teams, players, and brands tell us\
about how we (and others) see the world? Addressing topics from cricket in the Caribbean to boxing in\
Chicago, students reappraise conventional sporting narratives and use sports to analyze the social and\
historical conditions in which they occur. In doing so, students think critically about their own sporting\

ANTH 202 Decoding Disney: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Animated Blockbuster\
An anthropological analysis of Disney entertainment productions as "cultural texts." Students learn to\
discern America's contested beliefs and values by unearthing the cultural politics embedded in Disney's\
feature-length animated motion pictures. Students delve beyond apparent surface messages to reveal\
underlying tensions, recurring contradictions, and even counter-hegemonic themes. With respect to the\
particular intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and nation, what distinguishes this\
millennium's popular culture from productions of the early twentieth century? What American cultural\
continuities might we detect? Given the corporation's covert messages on love and sex, individualism and\
freedom, pleasure and entertainment, violence and conquest, what are the implications of Disney's\
increasingly global touch? Recommended background: familiarity with the Disney feature cartoon\
repertoire.\

ANTH 203 Cultural and Creative Expressions of the American Indian\
This course examines American Indian expression and settler colonialism in North American through a lens\
of Tribal Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory. The course establishes an understanding of settlercolonialism\
and its functions and impacts, including federal "Indian policy," the development of hegemonic\
control of all facets of American Indian society and its overreaches regarding tribal affiliation, racial tensions,\
land allocation, subsistence rights, and access, and their many intersects. Students consider dominant\
narratives, aided by critical theories, including hypotheses of the "peopling of the Americas," and the way in\
which the dominant hegemonic narrative has established regional histories and experiences of North\
American Indigenous/Native/First Nations people with persistent implications.\

ANLS 205 Citizenship, Borders, and Belonging\
Increasing levels of globalization have prompted scholars to predict the diminishing importance of national\
borders. Contrarily, in the age of detention, deportation, and refugee crises, citizenship has gained renewed\
importance. In this course, students explore different ways of organizing citizenship around the world from\
multiple perspectives including those of refugees, visa seekers, unauthorized immigrants, soldiers, and\
mothers, among others. They examine how formal framings of rights are shaped by a politics of\
representation where the ideal citizen is crafted and contested. They also consider how those excluded from\
legal and cultural citizenship form alternative structures of belonging.\

AMAN 207 Race, Racism, and Redress\
Recent events in the United States and around the globe have prompted a re-examination of the role of race\
in contemporary life. Since its inception, anthropology has been concerned with questions of human origins,\
diversity, and community. In this course, students examine the origins of racial thought, its transformation\
over time, and the ways race and intersecting identifications shape everyday life. Through ethnographies of\
global cultures, students explore how race takes form and meaning in different contexts. Throughout, they\
learn how to think critically about their own identities and beliefs and engage with strategies for redress.\

ANTH 210 Ethnographic Methods\
This course is designed to introduce students to ethnographic research methods and ethics. Student begin\
with a review of early ethnographic "fieldwork" methods-a defining feature of anthropology that includes\
conducting research in situ to create an in-depth and complex understanding of cultural practices, social\
processes, and the human condition. While drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary sources, students\
critically examine cultural anthropology\'92s primary methods: participant observation, qualitative\
interviewing, archival research, writing fieldnotes, visual media (photography, drawing, film) and apply\
some of these tools to ethnographic projects over the course of the semester. This course also builds from\
decolonial methods from a wide-range of historically marginalized perspectives and, as such, will interrogate\
the politics of knowledge production, which include research collection, analysis, and representation.\
Throughout the course, students reflect on the ethical dimensions of conducting research with human\
subjects, considering how social issues impact a diversity of communities within and outside of the U.S., as\
well as how communities make sense of and develop responses to social issues. Ultimately, this course seeks\
not just to provide students with a toolkit of ethnographic methods, but also to enable them to think\
expansively about the politics of those methods and the conditions in which those methods are used.\

created intimate forms of violence in Latin America. They examine how the legacy of colonialism is\
maintained through discourses and national narratives that uphold racial democracy, and how historically\
marginalized populations have fought against such harmful claims under dictatorships and democratic\
governments. Prerequisite(s): one course in anthropology, economics, education, history, politics,\

interdisciplinary character of the field, and the diverse analytical approaches to music making undertaken by\
ethnomusicologists over time. The centrality of fieldwork and ethnography to the discipline is also a core\
concept of the course. Through readings, multimedia, and discussion, students examine relationships among\
ethnomusicology, musicology, anthropology, and world music, and consider the implications of\
globalization to the field as a whole. Students explore applied music learning as well as performance as a\
research technique through participation in several hands-on workshops with the Cheltenham Gamelan Ensemble.\

our lives and a fundamental aspect of human cognition and human culture: understanding how it works is\
an important step toward understanding ourselves. The course covers the structure of language (sounds,\
words, sentences, and meaning) as well as various topics in anthropological linguistics (the role of language\
in human societies), psycholinguistics (how language is stored and processed), and historical linguistics (how\
languages change over time, and the roots of modern languages in the past). The course is designed for\

ANTH 216 Indigenous American Photography\
The practice of photography has a complicated history with regards to Indigenous American communities\
and cultures. The extensive photographs of Indigenous Americans created by Edward Curtis even now hold\
sway over America\'92s collective imaging of Indigenous American culture. And yet the late twentieth and early\
twenty-first centuries are rich with photographies of Indigenous Americans, representing themselves through\
the medium, new and vibrant ways of seeing, understanding, and representing Indigenous American\
cultures and histories. In this course, we begin with an overview study of how the process of colonization\
(specifically as it occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the era after the invention of\
photography), deployed the camera and photography to assert discursive control over Indigenous Americans.\
From that painful history, we move into study of the later twentieth century and early twenty-first century\
studying lens-based photographic and filmic works of contemporary Indigenous American artists. The goal\
of the course is to explore and better understand how the photographic image, as leveraged by Indigenous\
Americans, redresses and decolonizes the social landscape of our United States, and to honor the art works of\
these photographers.\

exist. A diverse range of contemporary art practices \'96- including painting, photography, film, music,\
performance, fashion, and new media -\'96 are considered in relation to key aspects of cultural, political, and\
social lives of Indigenous peoples. Students analyze, among other things, art as particular expressions of\
Indigenous cosmologies, the entanglement of Primitivism and modernity, art and native sovereignty,\
capitalism and Indigenous cultural futures, art and value in the marketplace, tourist art and the value of\
authenticity, art and national identity, and colonial and postcolonial art. Additionally, students engage with\
recent scholarship on decolonization and Indigenous studies, and current events related to the theme of the\
course.\

An introduction to the archaeology of North America throughout the past 20,000 years and earlier. Students\
examine current archaeological hypotheses of the "peopling of the Americas," and construct the most likely\
model based on their command of the literature and an independent critical analysis supporting their own\
hypothesis. Students review and reconcile the archaeological past with indigenous concepts such as oral\
histories and origin stories, challenging and expanding their world view to include non-Western concepts.\
The course applies critical theory perspectives, including indigenous-feminist and postcolonial theories, to\
assess the colonial process that archaeology has at times unwittingly imposed on North American native\
peoples.\

Most Americans have "seen" Africa only through non-African eyes, coming to "know" about African society\
through such characters as Tarzan and such genres as the "jungle melodrama" or the "nature show." In this\
course, films from the North Atlantic are juxtaposed with ethnographic and art films made by Africans in\
order to examine how to read these cinematic texts. Related written texts help to answer central questions\
not about "Africa" but rather about the politics of representation: What are the differences in how African\
societies are depicted? Why are particular issues and points of view privileged? Recommended background:\

ANGS 315 Queering Capitalism: Sexual Politics and Properties of Economic Life\
In this class, students investigate the history of the term queer(ing) in anthropology, and explore the\
intersectional relationship between LGBTQ+ people, theory, anthropology, and economics by \'93queering\
capitalism\'94. Students engage ethnographic accounts of LGBTQ lives and films and representations of\
cultures and economy in media that point to the significant relationship between queerness and capitalism.\
We look at capitalisms queer relationships and formations often \'93under the covers\'94 in mainstream economic\
anthropology to investigate the role of heteronormativity in studies of the family, kinship, relationships, and\
sexuality in global capitalist contexts. We then look at ethnographic accounts - stories and studies of everyday\
lives - that challenge our taken-for-granted views and \'93queer\'94 our understandings of capitalism.\

ANTH 339 Production and Reproduction\
Economic anthropology challenges the assumptions of conventional economics by analyzing economic\
behavior from a cross-cultural perspective. Designed for junior and senior economics and/or anthropology\
majors, this course looks at the relation between economy and society through a critical examination of\
neoclassical, substantivist, Marxist, and feminist approaches in anthropology. The relative merits of these\
explanatory paradigms are assessed as students engage ethnographic case material. Such "economic facts" as\
production, exchange, land tenure, marriage transactions, state formation, and social change in the modern\
world system are addressed, always in comparative perspective. Economics majors may select this course for\
major credit and are encouraged to enroll. Prerequisite(s): two courses in economics and/or anthropology.\

ANTH S12 Imagining Videogames: An Introduction to the Practices and Politics that Make\
Videogames Happen\
Before videogames reach the market, levels must be designed, characters drawn, narratives written, and\
mechanics coded. Before that, videogames must be imagined, tested, and pitched. This course is designed to\
allow students to experience for themselves those earliest stages of videogame development, when games\
move from idea to collaborative project. After working through some of the most influential scholarship on\
the politics of videogames and their design, and hearing from several industry experts about their experiences\
in the field, students form groups and work collaboratively to develop pitch materials for an imagined game.\
Groups pitch these ideas to each other at the end of the term, and each student submits an autoethnographic\

Studio Art Track\
The department offers courses in studio practice and in the study of the intersecting categories of art,\
architecture, visual culture, and material culture from the distant past to the present. This study also provides\
insights into intellectual currents, religious doctrines and practices, and social institutions, with attention to\
issues of class, gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Studio art involves the integration of\
traditional disciplines and methods with contemporary practices and the study of visual culture.\
Prospective majors should meet with the Art and Visual Culture faculty as first-year students. The major in\

Senior Project Description\
The [W3] Requirement Though in most disciplines, the senior thesis fulfills the third-level [W3] writing\
requirement for General Education, the senior thesis for the studio track in art and visual culture does not\
fulfill this requirement. Majors in the studio track fulfill their [W3] requirement by completing a [W2]\
course in any department or program during their senior year, which may include one of the three art\

history and criticism courses required for the studio major. Most studio majors who double major fulfill the\
[W3] requirement by completing the senior thesis in the second major.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Study Abroad: Studio majors intending to study abroad must consult with the department well in advance.\
In most cases, the department advises students who wish to study abroad to do so for only one semester.\
Students usually apply one studio course and one course in the history of art and visual culture taken abroad\
toward the major requirements. Studio courses taken abroad in fulfillment of major requirements should\
correspond to the studio curriculum offered at Cheltenham.\

AVCM 222 Seeing Gods in Ancient Greek Art, Architecture, and Myths\
Ancient gods and goddesses were everywhere in ancient Greece: they were painted on cups and plates; they\
stood tall on altars in sanctuaries and on the streets. Not surprisingly, the ancient Greeks reported talking to,\
smelling, and hearing divine beings of all sorts. This course explores how the Greeks depicted their gods and\
goddesses on vases, temples, and sculptures, and how such depictions relate to written reports of divine\
encounters. It provides an introduction to archaic and classical Greek art, the organization of religious\
sanctuaries, and myths about gods who were believed to meet with human beings. Recommended\

AVC 228 Connecting Image Cultures: Artistic Exchange between Islam and Europe\
Through lecture, discussion, object-based learning, and digital humanities projects, this course maps image\
and artistic exchange between the European and Islamic worlds from the eighteenth to the twenty-first\
century. Students explore reciprocal currents of visual and technological encounter in between imperial\
centers and across national borders. Taking a historical and critical view that highlights both continuities and\
ruptures between modernizing imperial social bodies, the course traces the ways material culture crosspollinated\
Mediterranean geographies, charting how images were made and re-made beyond the prospects of\
national heritage. Beginning with colonial rule in India, students examine transnational dialogues across\
London, Mumbai, Paris, Istanbul, Vienna, Tehran, Berlin, Baghdad, London, Cairo, Rome, and Mogadishu.\
Through case studies, students consider relationships among artists, printers, authors, and patrons in an\
increasingly global world.\

AVC 233 Decolonizing the Museum: Understanding Colonial Legacies, Display Practices, and\
Repatriation\
This course introduces students to the problematic and colonial histories upon which museums were built.\
Beginning with an introduction to postcolonial theory and institutional critique, students critically examine\
the containment of colonial objects and related efforts to control colonial bodies. By acknowledging colonial\
records and structural racism as the foundation upon which the modern museum was built, students grapple\
with historic and exploitative systems of power that formed the world\'92s first collections and still govern\
modes of display and interpretation today. Through experiential learning, the class engages with cases of\
repatriation and the marginalization of art histories from the Global South, and analyzes museum practice in\
relationship to global migration, COVID-19, the racial justice movement, climate change, and wars in Syria\
and Ukraine. The course uses the Cheltenham College Museum of Art and Cheltenham College Archives as sources of\
study.\

and misused in the modern era: the rise of race studies and "culture history" in the nineteenth century, the\
Nazis' use of archaeology as "evidence" for Germany\'92s Aryan past, and the deployment of medieval symbols\
by contemporary White Supremacists.\

The great reliquary towers called stupas (or "pagodas") are by far the most pervasive and symbolic form of\
Buddhist architecture in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Even in North America and Europe, they have\
become an essential part of Tibetan Buddhist communities. Stupas are symbols of illumination, repositories\
for the relics of enlightened Buddhists, and central to sacred narratives throughout the Buddhist world. They\
are also a universal symbol, conceived of as embodiments of metaphysical principles with manifold\
meanings. The course examines the vast array of architectural forms of stupas and artistic programs decorated\
on their gateways, balustrades, and galleries. It also explores religious concepts and symbolic motifs\
embodied in the architectural work.\

AVGS 345 Trans Studies in the Politics of Visibility\
Many people have welcomed the increased visibility of trans and/or gender-nonconforming people as a sign\
of progress. Yet who is visible, what constitutes visibility, and whom do particular visibilities benefit? This\
course uses a trans studies framework to consider both the products and the politics of visibility. Topics\
include the representation of queer gender and trans and/or gender-nonconforming people in contemporary\
visual culture; critiques of visibility in relation to state surveillance and white supremacy; and the\
interconnected roles of norms regarding race, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and ability in perceptions and\
practices of gender normativity and transgression. Recommended background: at least one course with\
substantial work in gender, queer, or trans studies or the study of visual culture.\

AVC 371 Landscape and Power\
Now more than ever, nineteenth-century survey campaigns, relics of colonial enterprise, resonate as global\
practices that share a pictorial language or "style" used to characterize topographical space in ways that\
combine discourses of science and art, cultural nostalgia and modernity, as well as amateur and official\
practices. They turn place into property and land into landscape, shaping territorial expansion and\
legitimizing imperial politics in the name of (proto)national identity. This course considers the transnational\
and temporal dynamics of survey histories from the "majority world," addressing the often-neglected\
narratives of landscape (particularly through photography) beyond the borders of Europe and North\
America. Prerequisite(s): two courses in the history of art and visual culture.\

AVC S20 African Photography\
This course examines the photography of the African continent from the mid-nineteenth century to\
contemporary times. Since its development, photography has served as a powerful medium to document the\
social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental landscapes of Africa. Indigenous and foreign\
photographers have focused their lenses and perceptions on the continent from the precolonial through postindependence\
eras. This course analyzes these photographs and the complex stories they tell, including ones\
of implicit bias and racism, colonial or nationalist propaganda, as well as the agency portrayed through\
narratives of daily life, the vibrancy of African photographic studios, and creative expressions by\
contemporary artists. Theories of photography, race, and gender are central to the course.\

How did medieval thinkers and artists envision Heaven, Hell, the Apocalypse, and the Last Judgment? How\
did visual representations of damnation and salvation change during the medieval period? Students analyze a\
variety of media (sculpture, paintings, mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, illuminated manuscripts, etc.) in\
order to gain a deeper understanding of the important and complex roles that concepts of judgment,\
damnation, and salvation played in the daily lives and visual environments of medieval Christians.\

of Art. They represent cultural richness and diversity in medium, and artistic expression, from the\
seventeenth century to the present in Asia. The course focuses on the art of shaman ritual objects from\
Southern China and Vietnam, on the popular images of the Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and the\
painting of flowers, birds, and water creatures from the Edo period, and on political propaganda posters\
from the mainland China. The course a) provides students with the first-hand experiences of viewing real\
objects in the museum; b) offers students the underpinned cultural contexts and original functions,\
meanings, purposes, and aesthetic concepts; c) helps students practice writing museum pamphlets and a\

AVC S25 Contemporary Global Photographies\
This course radically refocuses critical debates about contemporary photography on local image-making\
economies and vibrant centers of artistic production that too often sit at the margins of art historical\
discourse. It shifts the conversation away from dominant narratives that chart photographic history as a\
hegemonic Euro-American explosion of technology and instead orient thinking toward globalized\
photographic networks that connect continents, countries, and cultures. Through thematic lectures,\
discussions, and museum visits, students study photographic practices from outside of the Global North\
from 1980 to the present. This course seeks to decolonize the relationship between history and cultural\
representations by studying the international migration of photographs within the global art market.\
Students will complete a term-length object-based writing project, incorporating photographs at the Cheltenham\
College Art Museum.\

Analyzing how the history and architecture of museums has influenced paradigms of display and taxonomy,\
and how display and taxonomy have influenced museums and architecture, this course views the past in an\
attempt to identify characteristics of new museum ideologies of the twenty-first century. Few institutional\
concepts have the fortitude and resilience to continually defend and renew themselves from external attack\
and self-referential lethargy. The museum "conquers" by slowly assimilating cultural challenges. In the past\
hundred years, the museum has met these challenges while increasing its relevance and historical importance\
despite architectural makeovers, financial scandal, censorship, cultural shifts, and the ever-changing demands\
of new media. As the work shifts from analog to digital, museums are presenting exhibitions of painting,\
sculpture, photography, and video to ever-increasing audiences. Field trips are planned.\

Asian Studies\
In a globalized society, it is essential to find alternatives to U.S.-centric world views and create opportunities\
to center and learn from equally important voices and perspectives from around the world. We have much to\
learn from Asia\'92s complex experiences with local, regional, and global flows of privilege, power, colonialism,\
and ethnic conflict.\
Asian popular musics, cinema, and literature and film\'96including manga, anime, Bollywood, and martial arts\
films\'96have become mainstays in the world\'92s media sphere, while innovative new media cultures invite the\
world to encounter the new Asia. Despite an increasingly interconnected world, we encounter troubling\
stereotypes, prejudice, and racism within and toward Asia in today\'92s fast-paced global media, and politics, as\
well as in everyday encounters.\
By learning about the languages, histories, philosophies, politics, economies, literatures, arts, religions, and\
cultures of the many peoples of Asia and its diasporas, students gain the knowledge, contexts, and\
intercultural competency necessary to engage with a large part of the world that is largely underacknowledged\
in academic institutions outside Asia.\
Asian studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to encourage students to deepen their study of Asian\
cultures through courses and the senior thesis, along with rigorous training and expertise in Chinese or\
Japanese language. The program features three majors: Chinese, Japanese, and East Asian studies. In addition\
to the majors, the Program in Asian Studies offers minors in Chinese, Japanese, and Asian studies. Students\
are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a semester (or a full year) in China or Japan, as an integral part of\
the curriculum, for linguistic and cultural immersion, and for exploration on the ground. Faculty and\

ASIA 110 East Asia between Tradition and Modernity\
China, Japan, and Korea each had a watershed moment in which they transformed into modern,\
independent nations. This course first provides an introduction to traditional cultures, and then explores the\
violent changes that swept over East Asia from the mid-nineteenth century through the Chinese Civil War\
and the destruction of World War II. Imperialism, women's movements, and cultural nationalism are\
examined through an interdisciplinary approach that draws from intellectual history, literature, and visual\
and performing arts.\

ASIA 130 Japanese Film: Exploring Japanese Horror Films from the Silent Era to the Present\
Horror films are a familiar pop-culture touchstone, and many Americans are somewhat familiar with horror\
films from Japan. To deepen their appreciation of such films, students consider Japanese horror films in the\
context of genre theory and cinematic, psychological, social, political, and artistic elements. Students have\
the opportunity to think critically about popular films: What intellectual and artistic value do we find in\
genre films? How do we evaluate the claims of film scholars? Students also explore theory related to both\
filmic expression and horror themes, including psychoanalytic theory, feminist theory, film theory, and\
trauma theory. What does horror film say about the social, temporal, and cultural context from which it\
emerges? What does horror film say about filmmaking itself? How are formal filmic techniques used to\
express and induce fear and anxiety? No prior familiarity with Japan is required. Conducted in English.\

ASIA 289 Stupa Towers: Forms, Symbols, and Narratives in Buddhist Architecture\
The great reliquary towers called stupas (or "pagodas") are by far the most pervasive and symbolic form of\
Buddhist architecture in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Even in North America and Europe, they have\
become an essential part of Tibetan Buddhist communities. Stupas are symbols of illumination, repositories\
for the relics of enlightened Buddhists, and central to sacred narratives throughout the Buddhist world. They\
are also a universal symbol, conceived of as embodiments of metaphysical principles with manifold\
meanings. The course examines the vast array of architectural forms of stupas and artistic programs decorated\
on their gateways, balustrades, and galleries. It also explores religious concepts and symbolic motifs\
embodied in the architectural work.\

ASHI 301B From Tibet to Taiwan: Frontiers in Chinese History, 1700 to the Present\
This course investigates the twists and turns that attended the transition from imperial regime to modern\
nation in China. Perhaps two of the main legacies of China's last empire, the Qing (1644-1912), have been\
the territorial boundaries claimed by the People\'92s Republic and the tensions that have continued to erupt\
throughout the borderlands: Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Taiwan. This course deepens our understanding\
of modern China by considering why these frontiers are part of the contemporary nation-state and why their\
inclusion continues to be so contentious. Borderlands bring this transition into focus most clearly.\

ASHI 301N Mummies, Marauders, and Modernizers: Silk Road Cultural Contacts in the Heart of\

The Silk Roads crisscrossing the heart of Central Eurasia have been and continue to be significant conduits\
enabling contact among radically different people, goods, ideas, and practices. This course probes the most\
critical moments of intercultural contact in this region from ancient times to the present, and the scholarly\
debates they have inspired. From disagreements over the identities of mummified corpses in Western China,\
the impact of European explorers collecting cultural artifacts, and the role of Islam among the Mongols to\
Marxist-inspired campaigns to liberate women, the course considers how this region both reflects and shapes\
world historical patterns.\

This course investigates the deep historical roots of China's contemporary environmental dilemmas. From\
the Three Gorges Dam to persistent smog, a full understanding of the environment in China must reckon\
with millennia-old relationships between human and natural systems. In this course students explore the\
advent of grain agriculture, religious understandings of nature, the impact of bureaucratic states, and the\
environmental dimensions of imperial expansion as well as the nature of kinship and demographic change.\
The course concludes by turning to the socialist "conquest" of nature in the 1950s and 1960s and China's\
post-1980s fate.\

ASHS 303 Phillippine Literature in Spanish\
This course interrogates the status of the Spanish language and literature written in Spanish in the\
Philippines from 1873 to 1945. Through the study of foundational works by the late nineteenth-century\
Ilustrados, it explores how Spanish came to be a vehicle for movements of resistance and rebellion against\
400 years of Spain\'92s colonial domination of the archipelago. In novels, poetry, and essays by writers of the socalled\
Golden Age, it examines how Spanish persisted under the U.S. colonial occupation (1898-1945) to\
contest the imposition of English and Anglophone culture, and to cultivate a sense of Filipino nationhood\
alongside literary revivals of indigenous languages such as Tagalog, Cebuano, and Chavacano. Readings\
include works by Pedro Paterno, Jos\'e9 Rizal, Jes\'fas Balmori, Adelina Gurrea and Mar\'eda Paz Mendoza, among\

How did Buddhism first come to North America? How has it changed since its arrival? This course examines\
the development of Buddhism in the Americas since the nineteenth century. Students discuss different paths\
of Buddhist traditions from Asia to North America, and the ways that newly arrived Buddhists, and adopters\
of the tradition, have changed the face of what it means to be "Buddhist" in the "West." They consider\
shifting self-identification with the tradition, both among convert groups and in historically Buddhist\
communities, and the role of race and gender in the religion's development in the twenty-first century. The\
course includes brief trips to Dharma centers in the region as well as a "digital religion" component and\

JPN 130 Japanese Film: Exploring Japanese Horror Films from the Silent Era to the Present\
Horror films are a familiar pop-culture touchstone, and many Americans are somewhat familiar with horror\
films from Japan. To deepen their appreciation of such films, students consider Japanese horror films in the\
context of genre theory and cinematic, psychological, social, political, and artistic elements. Students have\
the opportunity to think critically about popular films: What intellectual and artistic value do we find in\
genre films? How do we evaluate the claims of film scholars? Students also explore theory related to both\
filmic expression and horror themes, including psychoanalytic theory, feminist theory, film theory, and\
trauma theory. What does horror film say about the social, temporal, and cultural context from which it\
emerges? What does horror film say about filmmaking itself? How are formal filmic techniques used to\
express and induce fear and anxiety? No prior familiarity with Japan is required. Conducted in English.\

Biology\
Biology is the study of living systems and how they interact with the nonliving world and with one another.\
It is a discipline that bridges the physical and social sciences. Students who major in biology become familiar\
with all levels of biological organization from molecules to ecosystems, and gain practical experience in both\
laboratory and field studies.\
The biology curriculum is under revision. During this transition there are distinct major requirements for\
the Class of 2022, the Class of 2023, and the Class of 2024 and beyond.\
More information is available on the Biology department website.\
Major Requirements\
1. Introductory Chemistry Sequence\
Complete the following courses:\
\'95 CHEM 107A Atomic and Molecular Structure/Lab\
\'95 CHEM 108A Chemical Reactivity/Lab\

3. Additional Courses\
Complete at least 12 courses in biology (11 credits - see 3b and 3c below), in which a minimum of nine\
must be taught by Cheltenham faculty. Only two introduction courses (100-level) may be applied to the major\
and only if taken during the first or sophomore year. The 12 courses must include:\
a. A four-course core, comprising:\
\'95 BIO 195 Lab-Based Biological Inquiry, typically taken in the first year\
\'95 BIO 202 Cellular Basis of Life\
\'95 BIO 204 Biological Research Experience: Molecules to Ecosystems\
\'95 BIO 206 Evolution and Interactions of Life\
Majors are strongly encouraged to complete these four core courses by the end of the sophomore\
year; they must be completed prior to the beginning of the senior year. The 200-level courses have\
BIO195 as a prerequisite.\
b. A biological skills course, taken in Short Term for 0.5 credits.\
c. A senior seminar, integrated with the departmental seminar series over both semesters of the senior\
year, for 0.5 credits total.\
d. A one-semester, research-based capstone, drawn from the following:\
\'95 BIO 457 Senior Thesis\
\'95 BIO 458 Senior Thesis\
\'95 BIO 472 Seminar and Research in Physiology/Lab\
\'95 BIO 473 Seminar and Research in Cell Biology\
\'95 BIO 476 Seminar and Research in Evolutionary Biology\
\'95 BIO 477 Seminar and Research in Microbiology/Lab\
Students may request permission to conduct a two-semester thesis, at the discretion of the thesis\
advisor and the department; this option is most appropriate for students considering graduate school\
and a career in research. A second semester of thesis can count toward the thirty-two credits required\
for graduation, but only one of the two thesis semesters count toward the major.\
e. Five additional biology courses (electives) to complete the 12 biology courses required, with the\
following additional caveats and permissions:\
At least two of the elective courses must be 200-level or above and taught by Cheltenham biology\
department faculty.\
The electives may include BIO 244 only if the quantitative requirement is not being fulfilled with\
BIO 244 or NRSC 205 (see item 2 above).\
One course from the following may be substituted for a maximum of one advanced biology course:\
\'95 CHEM 320 Mechanisms of Memory\
\'95 CHEM 321 Biological Chemistry I/Lab\
\'95 CHEM 322 Biological Chemistry II/Lab\

Return to Table of Contents\
\'95 NRSC 363 Physiological Psychology/Lab\
4. Completion of the comprehensive assessment requirement. This requirement is fulfilled by completing a\
departmental comprehensive assessment during the senior year.\
Senior Project Description\
Students may request permission to conduct a two-semester thesis, at the discretion of the thesis advisor and\
the department; this option is most appropriate for students considering graduate school and a career in\
research. A second semester of thesis can count toward the thirty-two credits required for graduation, but\
only one of the two thesis semesters counts toward the major.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Advanced Placement (AP), A-Level, and International Baccalaureate (IB) credit can continue to count toward\
the thirty-two credits required for graduation in accordance with College policies, but does not count toward\
the major (i.e., this credit cannot substitute for any course in the department and does not reduce the\
number of courses required for the major).\
Short Term Courses\
A biological skills course, taken in Short Term for 0.5 credits, is mandatory.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may be elected for courses applied toward the major except for: BIO 195, the 200-level core\
courses (202, 204, and 206), and all 400-level courses. Pass/Fail grading may be used only for the elective\
courses, to the extent allowed by Cheltenham\'92 general policies on Pass/Fail grading.\
Other Considerations\
Students may not major in biology and either biochemistry or neuroscience. Students may not major in\
biology and environmental studies if their environmental studies concentration is either 1) Ecology and\
Economics of the Environment or 2) Ecology and Earth Systems. Students planning to minor in chemistry\
may not use CHEM 321 or 322 toward both the chemistry minor and the biology major.\

BIO 322 Emergent Ecologies\
We are living on what has been described by some as a \'93damaged planet.\'94 Pollutants, ranging from tiny toxic\
particles to vast trash-filled gyres, unnatural disasters, unsustainable and unethical farming and fishing\
practices, the sixth mass extinction, and anthropogenic climate change have largely defined our current era.\
However, even in these treacherous times, filled with dystopian scenarios of apocalyptic devastation, new\
ecologies - relations - are formed. In this course, we look beyond the hopelessness to ask, what emergent\
ecologies are coming into being in the Anthropocene? Traversing the disciplines of conservation biology,\
ecology, ethology, geography, and anthropology, this course looks closely at the ideas of invasive species,\
extinction studies, and environmental management (among others) to examine what is living, even thriving,\
in uncertain times. Prerequisite: Any BIO195 and BIO 206\

BIPL 323E Philosophy of Evolution\
Evolutionary theory raises many deep and complicated philosophical issues as well as questions about how\
science operates: Are concepts like function, selection, and optimality scientifically legitimate? How do we\
make inferences about the unobserved past? Can thinking about the evolutionary past help us understand\
how biological processes, such as the mind, work today? It also raises questions about who we are and where\
we come from: How do we relate to other species? Can we better understand our moral and intellectual\
strengths and weaknesses by looking to evolution? In this course, students approach these questions from an\
interdisciplinary perspective, including philosophy, biology, and the cognitive sciences. Prerequisite(s): one\
of the following: PHIL 211; two courses in philosophy; or one course in philosophy and one course in\

Chemistry and Biochemistry\
Chemistry deals with phenomena that affect nearly every aspect of our lives and environment. A liberal arts\
education in this scientific and technological age should include some exposure to the theories, laws,\
applications, and potential of this science.\
The department offers majors in chemistry and biochemistry and a minor in chemistry. The chemistry\
curriculum is sufficiently flexible to allow students with career interests in areas such as the health\
professions, law, business, and education to design a suitable major program. Students interested in careers\
in chemistry or biochemistry will find chemistry electives that provide a background for work in graduate\
school, industry, or other positions requiring a strong foundation in chemistry. The department and its\
curriculum are approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS), and an ACS-certified major is offered.\
More information is available on the Chemistry and Biochemistry department website.\
Biochemistry Major Requirements\
Biochemistry encompasses the study of the form and function of the proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and\
nucleic acids found in living organisms. Traditionally, biochemistry has been an interdisciplinary field,\

CHEM 303 Modern Data Acquisition and Analysis\
Making measurements is a key element of chemistry and other physical sciences. Measurements made with\
commercial turn-key instruments typically employ operations whose details are obscured by slick user\
interfaces. To help students make fuller and more sophisticated use of such instruments, this course provides\
a hands-on introduction to the details of the hidden operations: simple analog electronics, digital data\
acquisition, and computer-based data analysis. Students create simple electronic circuits, use the LabVIEW\
programming language to program computers to generate and acquire electronic signals, and apply\
MATLAB software to analyze and extract meaning from the measurements they make. Relatively simple\
experiments and devices relevant to the physical sciences provide opportunities to put the ideas and\
techniques discussed into practice. Neither experience with computer programming (in LabVIEW,\
MATLAB, or otherwise) nor knowledge of electronics is assumed. Prerequisite(s): CHEM 108, PHYS 108, or\
PHYS 109. Recommended background: MATH 106.\

BICH 304 Biochemistry of Virus Replication and Host Cell Defense Systems\
Viruses that infect eukaryotic cells have evolved a wide range of strategies to co-opt the biochemical\
machinery of host cells for the purpose of maximizing virus replication success. Eukaryotic cells have\
simultaneously evolved mechanisms to limit the extent to which viruses can establish successful infections.\
This course examines, in large part through the primary literature, the replication biochemistry used by\
representative examples of mammalian viruses and the cellular biochemical pathways designed to defend\
cells and organisms from viral takeover. Students are expected to apply what they learn by preparing a grant\
application narrative as a final project. Prerequisite(s): BIO 242, or BIO 195 and 202, and CHEM 218.\

Classical and Medieval Studies\
The Program in Classical and Medieval Studies combines a uniquely interdisciplinary study of cultural\
history with an emphasis on empowering students to read and assess texts in the relevant ancient languages.\
The Cheltenham program is distinctive in its scope, linking the study of classical antiquity with that of the Middle\
Ages. This broad chronology, coupled with a broad geographical and cultural range, encourages students in\
the program to examine the long track of history \'96 to see how humans act and react with each other, with\
their environments, and with their pasts\'97and futures. Learning the languages of these ancient and medieval\
peoples is central to this inquiry, so students can engage more directly and authoritatively with primary\
sources. Grounded in these language skills, students in the program examine the past through a range of\
different lenses: art, architecture, drama, literature, philosophy, religion, and social and cultural history.\
The program centers historical questions about power, oppression, and the constructed nature of culture,\
identity, and the past itself. As such, the program embraces the global context of ancient and medieval\
Mediterranean cultures, from northern Europe and Scandinavia to Central Asia, and from North and West\
Africa to the Indian Ocean. Many diverse cultures constituted ancient "Greece" and "Rome," including\
North Africa and the Near East as well as Crete and Sicily. The program\'92s definitions of the medieval period\
encompass the diverse cultures and societies of Africa, Europe, and West and Central Asia, including the\
civilization of Islam, the Byzantines, and the Latin and vernacular cultures of Western Europe, from the\
Visigoths and Vikings to Middle English poets and the builders of the great Gothic cathedrals, while\
considering throughout those who lived within these societies as minorities.\
More information is available on the Classical and Medieval Studies program website.\
Major Requirements\
Within the major students may elect to concentrate in either classical studies or medieval studies. The major\
requires twelve courses, and may include a Short Term course.\

\'95 CMS 457 Senior Thesis\
\'95 CMS 458 Senior Thesis\
Typically, majors complete a one-semester thesis. Thesis advisors are chosen by the chair of the program\
in consultation with students, according to the topic of the thesis. Additional information is available on\
the Classical and Medieval Studies website.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Students are encouraged to study abroad in selected programs in order to engage more directly with the\
material aspects of these diverse cultures. Courses taken in college-approved study abroad programs may be\
used in partial fulfillment of the major in classical and medieval studies. Students seeking to receive classical\
and medieval studies major credit for summer courses in ancient languages (ancient Greek or Latin) should\
obtain permission from the classical and medieval studies program committee before undertaking the course\
of study. Advanced Placement examination scores of four or five in Latin may be used toward the college's\
graduation requirements and may be used to help place students in Latin courses, but may not count toward\
the major, minor, nor General Education Concentration requirements. Generally speaking, the Cheltenham\
classical and medieval studies program does not grant credit for online courses, including online language\
classes, to fulfill its requirements. If a student wishes to seek an exception to this rule, they should consult the\
program chair and gain the approval of the program committee before enrolling in such a course.\
Short Term Courses\
The major may include a Short Term courses.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for the ancient language courses required for the major.\

Greek Minor Requirements\
The study of ancient Greek and Latin language is an important component of the major in classical and\
medieval studies. Ancient languages are the royal road to a complicated and vital past which, for better or\
worse, still haunts our present. In addition, the study of ancient Greek and Latin language has practical and\
professional benefits. Graduate programs in English and modern languages, for example, frequently require\
reading knowledge of either ancient Greek or Latin, and professional programs in law and medicine often\
favor applicants who have studied an ancient language. Studying either ancient Greek or Latin not only\
offers insight into English vocabulary but also leads to understanding how languages work and hence to\
improving one's own writing skills and logical thinking.\
First-year students with backgrounds in ancient Greek and Latin should consult with faculty on arrival on\
campus to determine their course level for enrollment. Courses at the 200 and 300 levels have been created\
for second-, third-, and fourth-year students. Students who have had only one year of college-level ancient\
Greek or Latin at Cheltenham or the equivalent at another institution should register for the 200-level course. All\
other students should register for the 300-level course. During some semesters, second-year students may\
meet separately from upper-division students. In other semesters, students meet collectively for two of three\
classes per week and divide into smaller groups to accommodate their individual needs. All courses focus on\
improving language skills (developing vocabulary, increasing reading comprehension, and learning meter if\
appropriate) as well as exploring the historical context of the author(s) studied.\
A minor in ancient Greek requires a minimum of six courses in ancient Greek and one course in translation\
from among the following:\
\'95 CM/HI 100. Introduction to the Ancient World.\
\'95 CM/HI 102. Medieval Worlds.\
\'95 CM/HI 108. Roman Civilization: The Republic.\
\'95 CM/HI 112. Ancient Greek History.\
\'95 AV/CM 251. The Age of the Cathedrals.\
\'95 AV/CM 252. Art of the Middle Ages.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
A student may petition to have up to three comparable courses, completed at institutions either in the\
United States or abroad, apply toward the minor. These may include one course in translation as well as\
language courses. Majors in classical and medieval studies may pursue a minor only in the ancient language\
not used to fulfill their major requirements. Advanced Placement courses may not be applied toward the\
minor.\

CMS 107 Race Reception and the Modern Creation of the Ancient and Medieval Past\
This course is designed to introduce students to the ways in which the study of the classical and medieval\
worlds has been constructed alongside, and as an integral part of, modern systems of colonialism, racism and\
white supremacy. It aims, likewise, to introduce students to the ways in which the distant past, so\
constructed, continues to inform the contemporary world, both as a locus of oppression and of resistance.\
The course will, therefore, present students with the tools necessary to understand and critique these fields of\
study, as well as help them to more critically view the way they understand the past and the present.\

CMS 112 Ancient Greek History\
This course examines Greece from the Bronze Age to Alexander. It focuses on the geographical breadth and\
temporal extent of "Ancient Greece," and how that considerable space and time were negotiated and\
understood by the Greeks themselves. In such a far-flung world, extending from Sicily to Ionia, from the\
Black Sea to North Africa, Greeks experienced "Hellenicity" through sea lanes and land routes, and by means\
of a network of religious festivals and athletic meets, coordinated among multiple civic calendars. Topics\
include political structures, philosophies, literature, and modes of warfare.\

CMEN 121D The Many Lives of King Arthur\
King Arthur is called the "once and future king," but this malleable, mythic figure in some sense always lives\
in the present time. Approaching Arthur as an idea as much as a man, students analyze the ways in which the\
Arthur story has been adapted for different literary, social, and political purposes according to the needs and\
desires of its changing audience. They explore the features of the Arthurian legend which make it universally\
compelling, including feudal loyalty and kinship, women and marriage, questing and adventure, magic and\
monsters, violence and warfare, and consider the fierce debate over Arthur's historical and mythical origins.\

contemporary ideas on sexuality in the United States. Students explore the role of Greco-Roman material in\
discourses of sexual identity, freedom, and oppression from the first scientific studies of sexual behavior in\
the late nineteenth century to notions of sex, gender, and sexuality in the modern day. Throughout the\
course, students analyze texts from both ancient and modern contexts to see how classical culture has acted as\
an explanatory force in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and politics. Students also explore how\

The Vikings were the most feared and perhaps misunderstood people of their day. Savage raiders branded as\

the early Middle Ages. The Viking Age lasted for three centuries (800 - 1100 C.E. ), and the Vikings' world\
stretched from Russia to North America. Study of the myth and reality of Viking culture involves materials\
drawn from history, archaeology, mythology, and literature.\

CMDN 213 The Chorus Ancient and Modern: Forms of Communal Performance and the Body Politic\
This course investigates the chorus, a particular form of group perfomance developed in ancient Greece. It\
begins by exploring how the ancient chorus both praised and questioned the political systems that facilitated\
it before considering how choral performance in the modern period has been an effective tool for\
propaganda, riot, and revolt. Alongside works by ancient Greek poets, students look at a range of modern\
performance genres such as opera, ballet, sporting ceremonies, Broadway musicals, and flash mobs. Students\

Medieval Spain was a crossroads where the civilizations of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism met, mingled,\
and fought. Diverse and dynamic societies emerged, and from this climate of both tension and cooperation\
came a cultural and intellectual flowering that remains a hallmark of human achievement. Using a wide\
range of primary sources, this course focuses particularly on two key concepts in Spanish history: the\
Reconquista and the Convivencia. To examine these, students investigate the nature of conflict in medieval\
Spain and the ways in which those who lived there constructed and understood their communities.\

philosophy, rhetoric, poetry, graffiti, novels, and visual culture to discuss the lived experiences of Roman\
people, whether gladiators, senators, sex workers, or matrons. Special attention is paid to the diversity of\
experiences recorded outside of canonical texts, and the influence of foreign cultures on Roman thought and\

This course explores daily life and community in the Middle Ages through festivals, holidays, and marking\
the passage of the seasons. First, students are introduced to the format of both the natural and ritual year,\
and how individuals and groups responded to environmental factors. Second, they consider the role of such\
seasonal rituals as a means of creating social cohesion and coercion. Medieval festivals and holidays were not\
just fun: they frequently sought to impose specific visions of social and religious order on participants (and\
those who were excluded). Third, students reflect on how holidays and communal rituals still have power to\
shape community, identity, and belonging in contemporary society. The course helps students learn about\
medieval religious and cultural practices in a critical manner; while focusing on Christian traditions, they\
also consider Jewish and Muslim customs in a broader European context. Recommended background: prior\
coursework on the pre-modern world.\

AVCM 222 Seeing Gods in Ancient Greek Art, Architecture, and Myths\
Ancient gods and goddesses were everywhere in ancient Greece: they were painted on cups and plates; they\
stood tall on altars in sanctuaries and on the streets. Not surprisingly, the ancient Greeks reported talking to,\
smelling, and hearing divine beings of all sorts. This course explores how the Greeks depicted their gods and\
goddesses on vases, temples, and sculptures, and how such depictions relate to written reports of divine\
encounters. It provides an introduction to archaic and classical Greek art, the organization of religious\
sanctuaries, and myths about gods who were believed to meet with human beings. Recommended\

visual and cultural developments of the early medieval period. Beginning with the dissolution of the Western\
Roman Empire, students focus on emigration of Germanic tribes into Roman territories and the subsequent\
periods of Christianization, conflict, and exchange. Attention is paid to the ways medieval art has been used\
and misused in the modern era: the rise of race studies and "culture history" in the nineteenth century, the\
Nazis' use of archaeology as "evidence" for Germany\'92s Aryan past, and the deployment of medieval symbols\
by contemporary White Supremacists.\

CMS 266 Magic and the Supernatural in the Middle Ages\
For many, "medieval" is simply another word for "superstition" and the Middle Ages were consumed by\
delusion punctuated with witch trials. This course instead focuses on religious and folk practices beyond\
orthodox Christianity in the Middle Ages, to understand the realities of "magical" practice and supernatural\
beliefs during the period and move away from misconceptions based on Enlightenment polemic and\
modern fantasy. Students discover the variety of beliefs associated with the concepts of magic and\
supernatural and come to understand that these concepts were not always seen as evil, or even wrong, by\
contemporaries. Students consider the differences between how learned and unlearned magic were perceived\
and the gender dynamics at the heart of this dichotomy. They explore the syncretic relationship between\
medieval Christianity and paganism and other traditional beliefs, as well as the overlap between "magic" and\
primitive science. Recommended background: prior coursework on the pre-modern world.\

CMS 271 Ancient Philosophy\
What's the best way to live? For pleasure or for virtue? For oneself or for others? By the conventions of one's\
time or by some timeless truths? The fascination the ancient Greeks had with these questions was inextricably\
linked with others: What is the nature of the universe in which we live? What is the status of our knowledge\
of this universe? How can we understand the processes of change we see everywhere, including in ourselves?\
And what is the nature of philosophy itself? The course begins with the person who most famously asked\
these questions, Socrates, and on the writings in which he is most vividly portrayed, the dialogues of his\
student Plato. Students continue to pursue these questions through the writings of Aristotle as well as the\
famous schools of ancient philosophy, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Skeptics. No prior familiarity with\
philosophy is assumed; this is a perfect place to begin one's study of philosophy.\

Mediterranean worlds with those of the Indian Ocean. In the medieval period, the region flourished, with its\
history and society shaped by religion, trade, and politics. Christian states of Ethiopia sought both to pursue\
an independent expression of their faith and link themselves with the wider Christian world. Muslim states\
in Somalia sought political definition and economic power in a booming interconnected global community.\

Africans served both as anchors preserving Roman culture and society, and key agents in its transformation\
and devolution. Approaching the topic through primary and secondary sources, this course focuses on key\

attracted a great deal of scholarship, and looms large in the construction of modern national identities. The\
central question is not only how the ancient world became the medieval, and what that meant, but how and\
why this understanding has changed over the years, and why it matters. This course examines the period\
through the analysis of primary sources, key secondary sources, and historiography. Recommended\

CMS 395E Medieval Romance\
Romance was the most popular literary genre of the later Middle Ages. Originating in France in the twelfth\
century, this highly adaptable form quickly became an international phenomenon, with numerous examples\
found across Europe and the British Isles. Many romances tell tales of amorous exploits, exotic travels, and\
quests for knowledge; the celebration of chivalric ideals is a central theme. But many of these tales seem to\
question and sometimes undermine the very ideals they otherwise espouse: courtly love mingles with sexual\
adventurism, for instance, and loyalty to one's lord often results in alienation or death. Students read a\
selection of romances from France and Britain (all texts are in modern English translation or manageable\
Middle English) with an eye toward how they variously articulate and deconstruct the notion of chivalry.\

CMGS S20 Female Violence in Greek Tragedy and Beyond\
Women kill in Greek tragedy, and mostly they kill children. This course examines why, by exploring two\
tragedies by Euripides-Medea and Hecuba-in which the titular heroine, a non-Greek woman, kills young\
boys. Students read about infanticide, motherhood, enslavement, orphans, and immigration in ancient\
Greece in order to understand the historical context of these plays. Students also read comparative material\
in historical studies, anthropological studies, literary studies, gender and sexuality studies, and psychoanalytic\
literature in order to address Medea\'92s and Hecuba\'92s actions.\

CMS S22 Hell and Damnation: Imaging the Afterlife\
This course examines works of art produced in Europe from ca. 500 to 1500 C.E. and considers the ways in\
which the visual arts responded to and helped to shape premodern conceptions of death and the afterlife.\
How did medieval thinkers and artists envision Heaven, Hell, the Apocalypse, and the Last Judgment? How\
did visual representations of damnation and salvation change during the medieval period? Students analyze a\
variety of media (sculpture, paintings, mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, illuminated manuscripts, etc.) in\
order to gain a deeper understanding of the important and complex roles that concepts of judgment,\
damnation, and salvation played in the daily lives and visual environments of medieval Christians.\

CMS S51B Studying the Field: Race, Reception, and the Modern Creation of the Ancient and Medieval\
Past\
Through direct participation and research, students in this curricular innovation course play a foundational\
role in designing a new semester-length course in classical and medieval studies centered on building an\
antiracist, anticolonial understanding of the field. The course under development aims to introduce students\
to the ways in which the study of the classical and medieval worlds was constructed alongside, and as an\
integral part of, modern systems of colonialism, racism, and white supremacy. It aims, likewise, to provide\
students with the tools necessary to understand, critique, and improve these fields of study. Please note: This\
course has an extra cost of $185.\

GRK 101 Elementary Ancient Greek I\
The objective of the course, the first half of a yearlong sequence, is to begin a study of ancient Greek as a\
foundation for upper-level reading courses. It covers the basics of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary building.\
Students learn to read Greek sentences and passages and to translate from English into Greek. During the\
early stage much learning by rote of forms and rules is necessary, but students find that Greek is a structured\
and beautiful language, and the pleasure of reading "in the original" is inestimable.\

DCS 301C Public History in the Digital Age\
Public history takes place beyond history classrooms and academic contexts. Traditionally, it has been found\
in museums, walking tours, and performances, and has told the stories of people with social and political\
privilege. Increasingly, however, public history has come to focus on a greater range of voices, and takes place\
in a wider range of forms: on websites, graphic novels, interactive sensory experiences, social media, and\
other digital spaces. In this community-engaged course, students learn to see public history "in the wild,"\
engage with primary sources, and present those sources and historical interpretation to the public in digital\
form. Students with interests in history and public engagement are encouraged to enroll in this course.\

EACS 103 Earth Surface Environments and Environmental Change/Lab\
The Earth's surface environments are in a constant state of change resulting from the interaction of its\
atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere. Changes on the surface occur on various time scales\
from brief, severe storms to glaciations lasting thousands of years and changes in continents and ocean basin\
environments occurring over millions of years due to tectonic processes. Studies of surficial processes and\
materials illustrate the dynamic nature of the Earth and provide a key to understanding past and future\
environmental change. The lectures are complemented with field and laboratory study. Field experiences\
include day trips to local geologic settings and to the region's coast.\

Economics\
An understanding of economics can help foster intelligent citizenship. Policy makers in business,\
government, and the nonprofit sector frequently evaluate complex economic issues. The goal of the\
economics curriculum is to educate students, both majors and nonmajors, about the ideas of economics and\
how they apply to today's world.\
Introductory economics courses at Cheltenham (courses numbered 100\'96199) emphasize a broad nontechnical\
understanding of economic institutions, policy, and analysis. Courses numbered between 200 and 249\
provide nontechnical introductions to more specialized topics. Courses numbered between 250 and 299\
cover intermediate economic theory and introduce students to the methods of empirical analysis. Threehundred-\
level courses integrate practical economic issues with empirical and theoretical analyses, enabling\
students to develop sophisticated insight into both contemporary and historical economic problems.\
More information is available on the Economics department website.\
Major Requirements\
The department recommends that most students begin their study of economics by completing ECON 150,\
however those with an extensive background in economics and mathematics may begin their study of\
economics by taking ECON 260 or 270. ECON 150 does not count toward the major in economics.\
Students majoring in economics are not permitted to use C006 - Applying Mathematical Methods (C006) to\
satisfy General Education Concentration requirements.\

senior thesis (ECON 457 and ECON 458).\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Students receiving a score of four or five on either the Macroeconomics or Microeconomics AP exam receive\
credit for ECON 150. Students receiving a score of four or five on the Statistics AP exam receive credit for\
ECON 250. A-Level credit: Students receiving a grade of A or B on the A-Level Economics examinations may\
receive credit for ECON 150. No credit is given for the O-Level examinations. International Baccalaureate\
credit: Students receiving a grade of six or seven in the IB HL program may receive credit for ECON 150. No\
credit is given for the IB SL program. Students who have failed a core economics course (ECON 101, 103,\
150, 250, 255, 260, or 270) at Cheltenham may not receive major credit for an equivalent course taken at another\
institution. Students planning to study abroad should consult the off-campus study section of the economics\
department website. Most basic questions concerning departmental study-abroad requirements are answered\
there. Students should then consult with the department chair concerning the acceptability of particular\
courses for the major.\

Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for courses applied toward the major.\
Other Considerations\
Because of the numerous, vital, and constantly developing interconnections between economics and other\
social sciences, economics majors are urged to take as many courses as possible in related disciplines such as\
anthropology, history, politics, psychology, and sociology.\

ECMA 342 Optimal Control Theory with Economic Applications\
Optimal control theory unifies numerous economic problems related to the creation and use of physical\
capital. This course introduces optimal control theory as a tool for dynamic optimization and applies that\
theory to a variety of classic economic problems involving capital. Among the economic problems examined\
are optimal use of a renewable resource, optimal use of a nonrenewable resource, and optimal economic\
growth when growth begets pollution. The course includes formally proving Pontryagin's maximum\
principle, which characterizes dynamic optima, in the special case context of common economic problems.\

DCEC 368 Big Data and Economics\
Economics is at the forefront of developing statistical methods for analyzing data collected from\
uncontrolled sources. Since econometrics addresses challenges in estimation such as sample selection bias\
and treatment effects identification, the discipline is well-suited for the analysis of large and unsystematically\
collected datasets. This course introduces statistical (machine) learning methods, which have been developed\
for analyzing such datasets but which have only recently been implemented in economic research. The\
course also explores how econometrics and statistical learning methods cross-fertilize and can be used to\
advance knowledge in the numerous domains where large volumes of data are rapidly accumulating.\

ECON 373 The Economics of Crime, Punishment, and Rehabilitation\
This seminar explores a rational choice basis for understanding criminal behavior. Rather than framing the\
behavior of individuals involved in crime as fundamentally different from our own, students consider how\
environmental, economic, and legal constraints and incentives lead to criminal activity that is individually\
rational. Students examine empirical evidence of the effectiveness of justice reforms and use it to further\
understand the role of rational choice in criminal behavior, along with its limitations. Students also engage\
in community partnerships to directly observe the legal environment and better connect theoretical\
applications to the institutional and cultural setting. Prerequisite(s): ECON 255 and 260.\

Education\
The Cheltenham College Department of Education seeks to foster the democratic possibilities of schooling through\
the study of education in the United States and internationally. The aim of the department is to create an\
environment in which students and faculty together analyze the complex dynamics between the purposes\
and products of schooling and the social structures and cultural processes that constitute the broader context\
for education. In particular, the department aims to nurture in students the development of these qualities:\
Critical action and civic responsibility: The department wants students to develop a sense of social\
responsibility and concern for the common good, and so encourages them to become involved in the local\
community and beyond through fieldwork, community-engaged learning projects, policy analysis, student\
teaching, and empirical research.\
Reflection and engagement: In the department's vision of education, reflection and engagement work\
together to deepen students' understanding and foster their personal growth.\
Imagination and a passion for learning: With imagination, a passion for learning, and the skills and\
knowledge they develop, students are well-prepared to pursue their interests in education.\
Commitment to social justice: Throughout the program, students are encouraged to recognize and address\
the influence of social context on the democratic possibilities of schooling.\
Because education itself is an interdisciplinary area of study, the education department offers courses that\
attract students with a variety of interests. Some pursue educational studies as part of their exploration of\
liberal arts at Cheltenham. Some want to teach immediately after they graduate from Cheltenham or following graduate\
study. Others link their interest in social institutions, public policy, community, or families and children to a\
direct and deeper understanding of schools and schooling. Many students simply want to know more about\
education so that they can be better prepared to fulfill their future roles as citizens and parents. To encourage\
the integration of theory and practice, most education courses require a field placement in a local school or\
community setting. Students are expected to reflect systematically on the larger questions surrounding\
educational structures and practices raised through field experiences.\
More information is available on the Education department website.\
The Cheltenham Department of Education offers two minors in education: teacher education and educational\
studies. For both minors, students are required to take EDUC 231 (Perspectives on Education). This course\
introduces students to the field through foundational perspectives that stimulate further interest in\
education; it is open to first-year students. Students interested in declaring a minor in education are\
encouraged to come to information sessions offered twice during the academic year and to make\
appointments with education faculty for early planning and advisement.\
Teacher education offers graduates the ability to complete certification as public school teachers (7\'9612) in\
several disciplines including English, social studies, science, mathematics, modern languages (K\'9612), and art\
(K-12). Certification in theater or music may be available through transcript analysis; interested students\
should consult the director of teacher education. The program is approved by the State Board of\
Education, and students who are Teacher Ed program completers gain opportunities to teach through\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\

reciprocity with approximately forty-five other states. Some students may choose to enroll in the teacher\
education program even if they are interested in teaching or working in non-public institutions where\
certification is not required, because they gain significant experience in the classroom and in school settings.\
Educational studies offer students the opportunity to pursue a set of interdisciplinary courses that are\
designed around students' emerging interests in education policy practice, theory, and research.\
Students who wish to pursue a minor in education in either teacher education or educational studies should\
begin planning their course schedules no later than the sophomore year. With early planning they will be\
able to meet all of the requirements for a major and minor and to spend some time in off-campus study as\
well. Those students interested in the Teacher Education minor need to think about how to balance the\
demands of student teaching in their senior year with their course work and thesis.\
Teacher Education Minor Requirements\
Requirements for the College\'92s recommendation for certification in the region:\
1. Education Courses\
Complete the following courses:\
\'95 EDUC 231 Perspectives on Education\
\'95 EDUC 362 Basic Concepts in Special Education\
\'95 EDUC 447 Curriculum and Methods\
\'95 EDUC 448 Senior Seminar in Teacher Education: Reflection and Engagement\
\'95 EDUC 460 Student Teaching I\
\'95 EDUC 461 Student Teaching II\
\'95 One education department elective course (other than a first-year seminar)\
2. Subject Matter\
Complete 8 courses in the chosen subject matter for teaching (i.e. mathematics, English, social studies,\
physical science, life science, art).\
3. Degree Requirements\
Fulfill the College\'92s General Education and other degree requirements\
4. Fulfillment of state requirements, including fingerprinting. Licensing teachers is a state function;\
requirements differ from state to state, and these rules change frequently. Courses and experiences other\
than those offered at Cheltenham may be required for state certification. Students interested in certification\
should consult with a faculty member as early as possible to plan for required course work. Applications\
must be completed by 1 March of the sophomore year.\

Education Studies Minor Requirements\
A student choosing this option must complete seven courses, one of which may be from outside the\
department. Courses include:\
1. Education\
Complete the following courses:\
\'95 EDUC 231 Perspectives on Education\
\'95 EDUC 450 Seminar in Educational Studies, taken in the senior year\
2. Additional Courses\
Complete five additional courses, four of which must be education courses (first-year seminars may not\
count toward the minor), and only one of which may be a Short Term course.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Most education courses require at least thirty hours of field experience in educational settings or fieldwork\
related to education more generally, such as research on policy. Students may apply to have an off-campus\
program or course count as one of the six required education courses. These requests require the prior\
approval of the education faculty.\
Short Term Courses\
Students may count only one Short Term course toward the Education Studies minor.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may be elected for courses applied toward the minor.\
Other Considerations\
Title II "Report Card." An amendment to Title II, Higher Education Act (HEA), requires that states and\
institutions with teacher-preparation programs annually report to the public the pass rates of participants on\
assessments for teacher certification. The region no longer requires Praxis testing for successful completers of\
state-approved Teacher Education programs. Cheltenham enrolls between 2 and 15 seniors in this program each\
year, with a faculty ratio of no more than 6:1, but typically no more than 4:1. The current requirement for\
clinical experience in the program is 450 hours. Further information about the program is available from\
departmental faculty and staff.\

EDUC 221 Theory and Practice of Writing and Tutoring\
This course explores the intersection of thinking, learning, and writing, and in particular, the teaching and\
tutoring of writing. Students consider their own histories and perceptions of writing while expanding their\
understanding of writing and tutoring as practices, as fields of research, and as potential sites of social justice\
and antiracism. Through various collaborative and research activities, including preparing a panel\
presentation, tutoring philosophy, and electronic portfolio, students will critically examine writing center\
research and history, as well as theories and practices of language justice, peer-led learning, and critical\
thinking. Students apply course content by engaging their peers and faculty in other writing-intensive\
courses. Those who successfully complete the course will receive the title of Writing Fellow and be excellent\
candidates for positions as writing tutors with ARC.\

EDUC 378 Ethnographic Approaches to Education\
This course provides an introduction to fieldwork for those planning to conduct qualitative research for a\
thesis in the social sciences. Ethnography focuses on the daily lives and meaning-making processes of people\
who associate regularly in local networks, institutions, or communities. Ethnographers observe, interview,\
and participate in the routine activities of the people they study. They also explore the connections between\
locally situated activity and broader realms of symbolic meaning and social organization. This course\
introduces students to interpretive methods with which to examine the webs of meaning that give shape to\
educational spaces. Through active engagement in empirical research in educational settings across the\
city community, students grapple with theoretical assumptions, procedures, and standards of\
quality in ethnographic research. A thirty-hour field experience is required.\

EDGS 384 Education in a Globalized World\
We live in an era characterized by global flows of ideas and information, commodities, and people. In this\
course students examine the impacts of globalization on education policy and practice. Students explore how\
these transformative forces influence schools and schooling in different geographical, national, and cultural\
contexts. Topics address a set of concerns with enduring resonance to the field of educational studies,\
including social inequity and change; relations of power; and constructions of race, gender, and social class.\
A thirty-hour field experience is required.\

EDUC 390 Discipline, Race, and Schooling\
French philosopher Michel Foucault said that schools "serve the same social functions as prisons and mental\
institutions: to define, classify, control, and regulate people.\'94 We have all spent enough time in schools to\
understand this sentiment viscerally. Yet, depending on race and other ascribed social identity categories, we\
have experienced the disciplining potential of schools in starkly different terms. In this course, students\
examine racial disproportionality in rates of exclusionary discipline and ask how the more recent shift toward\
restorative approaches impacts black and brown students. Recommended background: EDUC 231.\

EDUC 447 Curriculum and Methods\
This course continues study of the concepts needed to understand curriculum design and program\
evaluation, and helps students develop the skills needed to design and teach curriculum units in their subject\
area. The course is part workshop: as part of the seminar (448, taken concurrently), students plan, develop,\

teach, and evaluate their own curriculum units. At the same time, students read about and reflect on classic\
questions in curriculum and instruction, such as: To what extent are teachers responsible for developing their\
own curriculum? Should curriculum and instruction focus on transmitting established knowledge,\
developing individuals' talents, or preparing successful members of society? Can teachers assess students'\
knowledge in ways that allow them to learn from the assessments? What particular teaching methods are\
appropriate for the different disciplines? Students develop a repertoire of methods to use in student teaching\
and in future teaching. Prerequisite(s): EDUC 231 and 460.\

The seminar helps students reflect on and engage with their experiences as teachers. Students refine their\
own philosophies of education and build on these philosophies to plan and teach classes in their placement.\
The seminar provides opportunities to reflect with critical inquiry on effective practices, and addresses\
essential questions such as: What does good teaching look like? How do I plan lessons to ensure student\
engagement? Why is it important to be a reflective practitioner? Candidates complete a state-mandated\
portfolio that demonstrates an understanding of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions expected of those\
entering the teaching profession. Prerequisite(s): EDUC 231, 362, and 460.\

EDUC 460 Student Teaching I\
This is an intensive field experience in secondary education. Students begin by observing a cooperating\
teacher in their academic field, spending one or two class periods each day in the middle or high school.\
Soon they begin teaching at least one class per day. In regular, informal meetings, they are guided and\
supported by their cooperating teachers and a supervisor from the Cheltenham Department of Education. Students\
also meet for seminar sessions at Cheltenham to address conceptual matters and to discuss problems and successes in\
the classroom. These seminars include workshops in content area methods and extensive informal reflective\
writing. Students begin to move toward proficiency in four areas of practice: curriculum, instruction, and\
evaluation; classroom management, interactions, and relationships; diversity; time management and\
organizational skills. Prerequisite(s): EDUC 231 and 362.\

This course explores the intersection of thinking, learning, and writing, and in particular, the teaching and\
tutoring of writing. Students receive the training and background necessary to engage students as writers,\
and to partner with faculty in the teaching of writing. Students explore writing across the curriculum\
(WAC), rhetoric and composition, writing center theory, peer-led learning, assignment design, active\
learning, and critical thinking. The course incorporates both seminar and practicum elements: students\
discuss readings drawn from the literature on writing centers and WAC, and apply the content of the course\
by supporting high school student writers in a thirty-hour field experience.\

EDUC S26 Qualitative Methods of Education Research\
Policymakers and practitioners often rely upon rich descriptive data to inform their understandings of\
schools and students. This sort of ethnographic, qualitative research typically involves observation and\
interviewing. This course introduces students to these methods, exploring the fundamentals of research\
design, data collection, and data analysis. Students consider questions concerning validity, positionality, and\
the ethics of qualitative research. Working in partnership with a local school or organization, students carry\
out a community-engaged qualitative research project, articulating research design, conducting observations\
and interviews, analyzing data, and presenting results. A thirty-hour field experience is required.\

EDUC S27 Literacy in the Community\
The field of "new literacy studies" calls into question the traditional emphasis upon discrete reading and\
writing skills. In an expanded definition scholars place literacy within anthropological and cross-cultural\
frameworks that consider reading and writing practices within families, communities, and cultures. This\
course introduces students to the literature of new literacy studies and educational anthropology in\
conjunction with a thirty-hour service-learning placement in the Lewiston area. The course also offers an\
introduction to English Language Learning pedagogy. Students are asked to investigate the impact culturally\
informed knowledge and experience have upon the literacy practices of those community members with\
whom they work closely.\

EDUC S32 (Don't) Say Gay: LGBTQIA+ Education in the United States\
In April 2022, Florida became the first state in over twenty years to prohibit the teaching of LGBTQIA+\
inclusive curricula in schools. Since then, similar bans have been put in place or are expected to follow in\
Ohio, Tennessee, Kansas, and Indiana. These newcomers join a coterie of states with preexisting restrictions\
including Texas and Mississippi. By contrast, Connecticut, Nevada, New Jersey, Illinois, Oregon, and\
Colorado have introduced and in some cases mandated LGBTQIA+-affirming curricula. In this course,\
students explore the divisive politics of teaching about queer identity, history, and experience in K-12\
schools. They familiarize themselves with research on the impact of gender- and sexuality-conscious policy\
and practice on American youth. The course has a required field placement component in which\
LGBTQIA+-affirming pedagogy is practiced. Students are expected to develop and demonstrate competency\
in evidence-based, best practices in working with queer youth.\

English\
Through a wide range of courses offered in English, students develop the ability to read closely and to engage\
in skilled textual analysis. They gain a sense of diverse literary histories and an understanding of literary\
genres. Deepening their engagement with literature, they formulate and test questions about texts and\
compare them critically. Students learn to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of critical sources,\
methods, and interpretations and to negotiate among them. Discussions and course work require students to\
develop their own ideas about texts and to present persuasive arguments in an articulate, responsive, and\
insightful manner, in both speech and writing. The English major prepares students for careers such as\
teaching, publishing, and writing, for graduate study in literature, and for graduate programs leading to the\
study or practice of medicine, law, public health, bioethics, and library science.\
Departmental offerings are intended to be taken in sequence. Courses at the 100 level are open to all\
students. Courses at the 200 level are more difficult in both the amount of material covered and the level of\
inquiry; they also address questions of theory and methodology in more self-conscious ways. Most 200-level\
courses have prerequisites. Seminars at the 300 level are generally for juniors and seniors who have\
completed several English courses (the latter requirement may be waived at the discretion of the instructor\
for certain interdisciplinary majors).\
More information is available on the English department website.\
Major Requirements\
For students not electing the option of a creative writing concentration, the eleven courses required for the\
major include the senior thesis and ten other courses, one or two courses of which may be taken at the 100-\
level, with the remaining taken at the 200-level and above.\
1. Critical Methods\
Complete the following course:\
\'95 ENG 296 Methods and Modes of Literary Study\
The critical methods course (ENG 296) is a prerequisite for the senior thesis. Students are strongly\

Major & Creative Writing Concentration Requirements\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
338\
Return to Table of Contents\
English majors who wish to write a creative thesis first complete the introductory and advanced workshops\
in either fiction or poetry, and broaden their workshop experience through the completion of a third\
workshop outside of their chosen genre. Requirements are the same as those for the English major, with the\
following additions and specifications:\
1. Introductory Workshop\
Complete at least one course from the following:\
\'95 ENG 291 Fiction Writing\
\'95 ENG 292 Poetry Writing\
2. Second Introductory Workshop\
Complete at least one course from the following:\
\'95 ENG 242 Screenwriting\
\'95 ENG 291 Fiction Writing\
\'95 ENG 292 Poetry Writing\
\'95 ENG 293 Creative Nonfiction Writing\
\'95 ENG 395G Autofiction\
\'95 THEA 240 Playwriting\
A second introductory workshop that is not the course chosen for the first workshop.\
A full-term or intensive summer writing workshop undertaken elsewhere. Requests for such\
substitutions must be made in writing to the chair, and include a syllabus and portfolio.\
3. Advanced Workshop\
Complete the following courses:\
\'95 ENG 391 Advanced Fiction Writing\
\'95 ENG 392 Advanced Poetry Writing\
This workshop should follow the student\'92s chosen genre.\
4. Allied Courses\
Three allied courses in the student\'92s chosen genre, often from among those taken to satisfy the major, in\
the English department or in the literature of another language, which will be useful to the student\'92s\
development as a writer, chosen in consultation with their advisor.\
5. Manuscript Thesis\
A thesis, undertaken during either one or, by approval, two semesters, consisting of a single cohesive\
manuscript in the chosen genre, or a closely-related hybrid genre.\
Majors who elect the creative writing program count one of the writing courses toward fulfillment of the\
English major requirements, as well as the allied literature courses, and thesis. Thus, the usual number of\
courses required for the English major and the creative writing program is 13. Students who elect to\
complete their second introductory workshop through Autofiction (ENG395G) may take 12.\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
339\
Return to Table of Contents\
Senior Project Description\
The thesis should comprise the best work brought, through intensive revision, to final form during the\
semester(s) spent working on the project. Theses may include revised developments of work first drafted in\
previous seminars or workshops, but should consist mainly of new work drafted and revised during the\
project. A copy of the original previous work should be provided to the thesis advisor if a student plans to\
draw on it in this way.\
Critical Theses:\
Students undertaking a critical thesis:\
1. Should consider the work they have done at the 200- or 300-level as generative ground for their thesis,\
identifying a set of texts and/or topics that grow out of the coursework they have completed in the\
Department. Students are encouraged, with approval of their advisor and the instructor, to select the\
\'93thesis through seminar\'94 option, using one of their two required junior-senior seminars as an anchor for\
their thesis work. This option permits students to get the thesis (and W3) requirement while\
simultaneously getting credit for the seminar.\
2. Must submit a proposal to the department, outlining their rationale (including relevant bibliography) for\
the project. Once the proposal is approved and assigned to an advisor, the student and advisor begin\
devising a working schedule for the project. Please take note: your thesis advisor must be a faculty\
member in the department whose research expertise aligns with the topic and methodology of your\
thesis.\
3. Should note that critical theses should be a minimum of 20 pages to be considered for passing credit;\
many theses will be longer, depending on the complexity of the topic and at the discretion of the advisor.\
Honors\
With departmental approval, students may write a two-semester honors thesis in the senior year. Majors who\
wish to present themselves as potential honors candidates are encouraged to register for at least one juniorsenior\
seminar in their junior year. Majors who elect to participate in a junior-year-abroad program and who\
also want to present themselves as honors candidates must submit evidence of broadly comparable course\
work or independent study pursued elsewhere; such persons are encouraged to consult with the department\
before their departure or early in their year abroad. Toward the end of their junior year, all prospective\
honors candidates must submit a two-page proposal and a one-page bibliography; those wishing to write a\
two-semester creative thesis must submit a one-page description of a project and a substantial writing sample.\
Creative Theses:\
Although most creative theses are composed in the genres of either fiction or poetry, it may be possible to\
write a thesis in creative nonfiction or a hybrid genre. The length and nature of such a project is determined\
by the student and their advisor.\
The broad outlines of expectation for one or two-semester creative theses are as follows:\
\'95 One-Semester Poetry: At least fifteen, but not much more than twenty poems. A preface of ca. ten\
pages should discuss craft, influences, and intentions.\
\'95 One-Semester Fiction: At least forty, but not much more than sixty pages of fiction. A preface of ca.\
ten pages should discuss craft, influences, and intentions.\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
340\
Return to Table of Contents\
\'95 Two-Semester Poetry: At least twenty-five, but not much more than thirty poems. A preface of ca.\
ten pages should discuss craft, influences, and intentions. A public presentation (reading) from the\
work, delivered at the Mount David Summit in their senior year, is optional but strongly\
encouraged.\
\'95 Two-Semester Fiction: At least seventy, but not much more than 100 pages of fiction (e.g., stories\
or novella). A preface of ca. ten pages should discuss craft, influences, and intentions. A public\
presentation (reading) from the work, delivered at the Mount David Summit in the senior year, is\
optional but strongly encouraged.\
\'95 Two-semester creative theses may be read for approval and comment by the advisor and another\
member of the Cheltenham faculty, not necessarily a member of the English department. Thesis authors\
seeking a second reader are responsible for securing such an agreement. Responsibility for\
assignment of a final grade rests with the thesis advisor.\
Students undertaking a creative thesis:\
1. Have successfully completed the three workshop courses required by the program. Students who have\
not yet done this, for reasons of off-campus study, for example, may undertake a creative thesis provided\
they take the remaining required writing course(s) by the end of senior year.\
2. Must submit a proposal to the department, requesting the opportunity to write a creative thesis and\
delineating their vision for the project. Once the proposal is approved and assigned to an advisor, the\
student and advisor begin devising a working schedule for the project.\
There is no honors designation for a creative thesis, but students may apply to write for two semesters,\
registering for ENG 457 and ENG 458, so long as they have completed the advanced workshop in their\
chosen genre before the fall of their senior year, or are otherwise approved to write for one full year.\
If the two-semester request is approved, the student proceeds with the understanding (as with English\
Department honors projects) that the advisor\'92s assessment of the work produced during the fall semester,\
and the student\'92s adherence to deadlines determine if the project goes forward beyond the end of fall\
semester. The creative writing committee, composed of those faculty engaged in teaching workshop courses\
that year, may decide that a thesis should be completed by the end of the fall semester, or it may also grant an\
advisor and student request to extend a thesis into a two-semester project.\
The department expects many creative theses to be completed in one semester, with most students using the\
advanced workshop to develop the foundation for their creative thesis.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Students may receive no more than two credits for semester-abroad courses, and, normally, no more than\
two credits for yearlong study-abroad courses. Under special circumstances, and upon written petition to the\
English department, students studying off campus for the year may receive credit for three courses. One\
course credit is granted for Advanced Placement scores of four or five. However, such credits count only\
toward overall graduation requirements, not toward the 11-course major requirement in English.\
Short Term Courses\
English Short Term courses may be counted toward the major at the discretion of the course instructor. A\
first-year seminar taught by a member of the English faculty may count toward the English major as a 100-\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\

Return to Table of Contents\
level course, at the instructor's discretion. Students not pursuing the creative writing concentration may\
count one course in creative writing toward the major.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for courses counting toward the major.\
Other Considerations\
Students planning to do graduate work \'97 whether an M.A. or Ph.D. or an M.F.A. in creative writing \'97\
should seek advice early concerning their undergraduate program, the range of graduate school experience,\
and vocational options. Most graduate programs require reading proficiency in two other languages, so it is\
strongly recommended that prospective graduate students achieve at least a two-year proficiency in a classical\
(Latin, Greek) or modern language.\

and their aftermath. Students consider the many ways in which ideas of national belonging intersect with\
practices of racial and other exclusions in the public cultures of mourning and memorialization that frame\
the idea of "9/11." Although the focus is on texts that engage with concepts of post-9/11 American culture,\
students also consider these events and their meanings in global contexts.\

ENG 113 Theory of Narrative\
The novelist E. M. Forster distinguished between "the king died and then the queen died," which is a story,\
and "the king died, and then the queen died of grief," which is a plot. How does the causal meaning of\
"then" explain narrative? Narratology provides a theory of reading that crosses literary criticism,\
neuroscience, and philosophy of law. This course, in examining causality, agency, event, and temporality,\
also may pursue recent questions that ask what role narratives play in understanding self, consciousness, and\
cognition and emotion.\

ENG 118 The Aesthetics of Seeing: Poetry as Witness\
This course explores poetry profoundly influenced by poets\'92 lived experiences as witnesses. Often the\
aesthetic of witness is one based in the traumatic: war, abuse, exile, and injustice. But this witnessing can also\
be the experience of observing kindness, joy, and beauty during times of inhumanity. The course examines\
how poets use what they have seen, what they have witnessed, to make poems. In effect, poetry preserves\
memories of the unmemorable. The course studies poems by Carolyn Forche, Yusef Komunyakaa, and\
Mahmoud Darwish, among others. Classes are discussion-based and include close readings of poems, group\
exercises, and short papers.\

ENG 119 "I, Too, Sing America": Poetry of this Moment/Movement\
In the tradition of Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes, American poets who explicitly wrote of the\
political and social anxieties of their country's moment, this course analyzes the work of contemporary poets\
responding to the current social and political moment in the United States. Students closely examine poetry\
that speaks from small-town America, environmental wreckage, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, the Standing\
Rock Dakota Pipeline movement as well as poetry that addresses our current political leadership. Readings\
include Claudia Rankine, Terrance Hayes, and Layli Long Soldier. Students engage these discussions through\
the production of critical examinations of the texts and through their own creative writing.\

CMEN 121D The Many Lives of King Arthur\
King Arthur is called the "once and future king," but this malleable, mythic figure in some sense always lives\
in the present time. Approaching Arthur as an idea as much as a man, students analyze the ways in which the\
Arthur story has been adapted for different literary, social, and political purposes according to the needs and\
desires of its changing audience. They explore the features of the Arthurian legend which make it universally\
compelling, including feudal loyalty and kinship, women and marriage, questing and adventure, magic and\
monsters, violence and warfare, and consider the fierce debate over Arthur's historical and mythical origins.\

ENGS 121G Asian American Women Writers\
This course introduces students to some major themes and concerns addressed in the literature of Asian\
American and Pacific Islander women writers. The course spans the twentieth century into the twenty-first,\
covering canonical and noncanonical texts, including novels, poetry, short stories, memoirs, and\
experimental and visual texts by Sui Sin Far, Maxine Hong Kingston, Hisaye Yamamoto, Lisa Linn Kanae,\

In this colloquium, students read broadly-from the magical waterways of classical antiquity to the American\
folk tradition that takes us "down by the riverside"-in order to better understand the human need to write\
about rivers. Students consider verse by Whitman, Walcott, and Spark alongside Twain's stories of\
Huckleberry Finn and the classic angling novella A River Runs Through It. From the local riparian zone on\
the banks of the River, students follow contemporary currents of ecocritical inquiry, investigating\
moments when the landed human body is literally or figuratively swept away by a torrent of fresh water.\

ENG 131 Tragedy and the Drama of Voice\
"Why does tragedy exist?" asks Anne Carson. The answer: "Because you are full of rage. And why are you full\
of rage? Because you are full of grief." This course explores how dramatic tragedy expresses such rage and\
such grief through the medium of the embodied, dramatic voice. By probing the voice's place in tragedy,\
emotion, and politics, students seek to better understand tragedy as a genre. Students read two classical\
tragedies and two Shakespearean tragedies, each alongside an adaptation by modern artists who rethink how\
tragedy works and whom it serves.\

ENG 142 Early American Literature\
The diverse traditions that comprise colonial American literature, from the early seventeenth century to the\
late eighteenth, arguably not only culminated in the creation of a national literature but in the nation itself.\
This course tests this thesis through a broad range of readings, including scholarly texts and historical\
documents, and ranging from fifteenth- and sixteenth-century European accounts of "New World"\
exploration through the turn of the nineteenth century, including the emergence of a distinctive tradition of\
the American novel. Additional course readings may include representations of early America in nineteenthand\
twentieth-century literature. In considering the nation\'92s early history in relation to its early literature,\
students examine what might have been alongside what came to be, as debates over slavery, revolution and\
war, women\'92s roles, models of governance, and indigenous peoples\'92 rights played out in prose, verse, and\
oration.\

not only as a moment of unprecedented historical change, but also as a narrative problem. How did writers\
and filmmakers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century represent the momentous shift from\
slavery to freedom? How were conventional genres and formal strategies - from romance to tragedy and from\
marriage plots to flashbacks - used to tell wildly divergent stories about this contentious period in U.S.\
history? And how have more recent writers and filmmakers taken up what often seems the unfinished\
business of Reconstruction? Prerequisite(s): one English course.\

the plot against his life, the voyages of British people to a \'93new world,\'94 the English Civil Wars and\
establishment of a protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, the Restoration of the monarchy, the Great Plague\
and Great Fire of the 1660s, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. They trace the evolution of scientific\
thought from Francis Bacon to Isaac Newton. How was the world made? Does our species have dominion\
over all others? What happens to our souls and bodies after death? And how should people be governed?\
These questions blur the line between the animal and the political. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English\

ENG 239 Shakespeare's Queens\
When Shakespeare began writing plays, England was ruled by a queen. Elizabeth I understood that her\
power was inextricable from her gender, and she developed intricate iconography and ideology to support\
her queenly rule-iconography and ideology which also made it into some of the greatest art of the age. This\
course considers the question of queenship in Shakespeare's poetry and plays. Centralizing concerns of\
gender-including those of sovereign rule, race, queerness, desire, religion, agency, performativity, and\
intersectionality-students work to understand forms of "queenship" in playful as well as serious ways.\

Some scholars of Romanticism contend that it cannot be defined. Others have insisted on maintaining\
national divides between the movement to preserve purist genealogies.Still others have argued that it can be\
viewed as a reaction against the way of life in capitalist societies. This course reexamines the origins and\
breadth of Romanticism, beginning first with the traditionally studied German Novelle and British poetry\
and then shifting to other national and transnational works that have not previously been associated with\
Romanticism as a movement, such as romantic racialized paintings of Native Americans, Frederick Douglass\'92\
\'93The Heroic Slave,\'94 and the Haitian rebellion. The course breaks down Romanticism past definitional\
monolith and asks how capitalism, nationalism, revolution, and transatlanticism revise past scholarly\
approaches to the movement and further contextualize it within the global world. Prerequisite(s): one 100-\

AFEN 255 Black Poetry\
How does the African American poetic tradition specifically contribute to the literary canon of African\
American literature and larger conceptions of American and global literature? This course is both an\
introduction to Black poetics and a deep exploration. The course considers so-called basic questions (e.g.,\

What are Black poetics?) and more sophisticated questions (e.g., How do Black poetics transform the literary\

politics, including such canonical authors as Langston Hughes and Nikki Giovanni, and less well-known\
authors such as Jayne Cortez and LL Cool J.\

This course examines selected autobiographical writings of ex-slaves; biographical accounts of the lives of\
former slaves written by abolitionists, relatives, or friends; the oral histories of ex-slaves collected in the early\
to mid-twentieth century; and the fiction, poems, and dramas about slaves and slavery (neo-slave narratives)\
of the last hundred years. Students consider these works as interventions in the discourses of freedomreligious,\
political, legal, and psychological-and as examples of a genre foundational to many literary works\
by descendants of Africans in diaspora. The course surveys early works written by slaves themselves, such as\
broadsides and books by Jupiter Hammond, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Jacobs; dictated biographies\
such as those by Esteban Montejo, Mary Prince, and Sor Teresa Chicaba; and fictional works inspired by the\
narratives, such as texts by Toni Morrison, Gayl Jones, Charles Johnson, Michelle Cliff, Sherley Ann\

This course explores a variety of interpretations and appropriations of Shakespearean tragedies, comedies,\
romances spanning the past century. In the context of modern cinematic adaptation, Shakespearean plays\
transform beyond themselves, often distorted or reworked to represent anachronistic cultural concerns.\
Students analyze linguistic, social, and historical contexts in the Shakespearean original and then\
comparatively considers these readings against their modern remakings: Are there limits to adaptation? What\
relates the original to the later work? How do we assess the evolving discourse of film reception studies? The\
focus shifts between comedy and tragedy, tragedy and romance, often redefining set assumptions about these\
thematic categories in the Shakespearean context. Adaptations include Japanese epic cinema, Hollywood\
screwball comedies, prison performance, militaristic stagings, avant-garde experimental film, and formulaic\
romantic comedies.\

ENG 274 "Forgive Us Our Trespasses": Deviant Wanderings of Four Eighteenth-Century Writers\
This course critically compares four writers of the eighteenth-century European tradition who on first glance\
seem to have little in common: Aphra Behn, Samuel Johnson, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Ann Radcliffe.\
Students consider these writers\'92 gender performance, satire, lexicography, political philosophy, confessional\
autobiography, Gothic novels, and painterly travelscapes. How does their choice of genre serve as social\
commentary, (a)moral expos\'e9, or visual escapism? Does their work revise our definition of an eighteenthcentury\
writer? Drawing on critical gender studies, political philosophy, literary criticism, and theories of the\
Baroque help make sense of how such unlikely comparisons allow us to read this eighteenth-century\
episteme as an example of moral "enforcement." Recommended background: ENG 232 and 243.\

Schoenberg, Schnitzler, Pissarro, and Chagall. It investigates both positive Jewish images and anti-Semitism\
in such novels as Celine\'92s Journey to the End of the Night, Dickens\'92 Our Mutual Friend, Melville\'92s epic\

This course studies the historical contexts and artistic afterlives of Paradise Lost. Milton's epic was greatly\

imperial projects of Britain and Europe, to name but a few. So too, has the poem greatly influenced art and\
literature concerned with revolution and revolt, imperial power, religious freedom and/or persecution,\
gender politics, and humanity's relationship to nature and "fall" from an "Edenic" world. Students study\
Paradise Lost alongside its influences and some of the texts it has influenced, considering both how the poem\
creates meaning in its own context, and how it has come to signify far beyond that context. Prerequisite(s):\

ENG 286 Race before Race: Articulating Difference in Medieval England\
The medieval period is often wrongly perceived as a time that existed before the idea of race: before the\
Atlantic slave trade and before European colonialism, the Middle Ages might seem to be free of racial bias,\
and free of difference itself. Such fantasies of a preracial or hegemonic past also have given rise to white\
supremacist ideologies of racialized nationalism, including the mythic construction of "Anglo-Saxon"\
heritage. This course addresses these errors by examining how racial categories of human difference were\
articulated in specific cultural contexts between 1150 and 1415, arguably inventing many of the\
dehumanizing tropes of racial discourse that persist today.\

students write four creative nonfiction essays in the following genres: memoir, lyric, travelogue, and art\
review. Students learn to see writing as an act, not as a product. To that end, the course includes workshops\
in which ideas and critiques of writing assignments are thoughtfully offered. To further fuel the writing\
assignments and workshops students read a wide-ranging selection of creative nonfiction essays, studying\
figurative language, character and setting development, and dramatic structure.\

Weekend (1967), to the philosophical meditation of In Praise of Love (2001). Each week course participants\
study one film by directors such as Antonioni, Bergman, Dreyer, Fellini, Marker, Pasolini, Tarkovsky, and\
Truffaut. Taken together, Godard and these European directors show why twentieth-century film is truly\
"the seventh art." Prerequisite(s): one English course.\

Grappling with gender and species at once, this course considers two concepts that have enforced binary\

students examine representations that push against received formulations of man/woman and\
human/animal. How have categories of gender and species reinforced one another in figurations of living\
bodies and their experiences? Can we liberate our reading from either of these binaries? What are the\
promises of such a liberation? Readings include theoretical interventions from animal studies,\
posthumanism, queer and transgender theory, and ecofeminism. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English\

ENG 395E Medieval Romance\
Romance was the most popular literary genre of the later Middle Ages. Originating in France in the twelfth\
century, this highly adaptable form quickly became an international phenomenon, with numerous examples\
found across Europe and the British Isles. Many romances tell tales of amorous exploits, exotic travels, and\
quests for knowledge; the celebration of chivalric ideals is a central theme. But many of these tales seem to\
question and sometimes undermine the very ideals they otherwise espouse: courtly love mingles with sexual\
adventurism, for instance, and loyalty to one's lord often results in alienation or death. Students read a\
selection of romances from France and Britain (all texts are in modern English translation or manageable\
Middle English) with an eye toward how they variously articulate and deconstruct the notion of chivalry.\

ENG 395H Shakespeare\'92s Masterpiece? Revisiting King Lear\
Reading King Lear today means exploring its histories of (mis)appropriations and cultural reception. In\
order to explain the play, critics and scholars have been drawn to major historical events in Jacobean England\
(e.g., the Gunpowder Plot of 1604 or the London plague of 1603), often incorporating these analyses into\
their critical approaches, such as new historicism, Holocaust literature, ecocriticism, and textual instability.\
This course considers King Lear both textually and culturally, asking: How does the aesthetic upholding of\
the play as a "masterpiece" inform, trouble, or extend its long reception history? How do past explanations\
impress themselves upon contemporary interpretations? Recommended background: ENG 213, 214, and\
239.\

ENG 395J Frontier and Border in U.S. Literature\
The American "frontier" has long been a controlling idea in the production of U.S. national identity: less\
physical reality than ideological framework, what historian Frederick Jackson Turner called "the meeting\
point between savagery and civilization." Drawing on theoretical and historical writings, studied alongside\
twentieth-century U.S. literary texts, this course examines the history and legacy of this concept, and the new\
interpretive and cultural paradigms of "the border" that have supplanted Turner's "frontier thesis." Studying\
the border as "contact zone," students read widely in Chicana/o and Native American literatures, studying\
connections and commonalities in what are often treated as distinct traditions, toward a more nuanced\
understanding of the diverse territories -- real and imagined -- engaged by critical discourses of the border.\
Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English course or one American studies course.\

ENG 395K The Arctic Sublime\
Now the focus of grave concerns over climate change, the Arctic generated a different set of anxieties in the\
nineteenth century. Perceived as strange and terrifying, and deadly to those who tried to chart and conquer\
it, the region was a source of the sublime; its inhuman greatness both inspired and appalled. Drawing on\
various genres, students examine the "Arctic sublime," considering its artistic and ideological purposes for\
Romantics and Victorians. Works include Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," Mary Shelley's\
Frankenstein, and Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym as well as works of visual art and selections from\
nineteenth-century theorists of the sublime. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English course.\

ENG 395L Utopia/Dystopia Fiction\
What does it mean to live the "good life"? How is this related to building, planning, desiring, or dwelling in\
a "good place"? How do plans and policies for good life morph into bad places? Are good places always\
exclusionary, and thus foundationally bad places for some? This course traces two trends side by side: the\
early modern vogue for utopia-fictions, such as Thomas More's Utopia, and the twentieth- and twenty-firstcentury\
turn to dystopia-fictions, such as Orwell\'92s 1984. Students consider relationships of genre, politics,\
identity, modernity, and colonialism between these two trends, while broadly considering the relationship\
among power, place, and community.\

ENG 395O Cinema's Inner World\
The cinema seems best able to show the outsides of things: specific places, the details of daily life, the faces of\
people. A complex inner life is perhaps better left to literature. Yet some film directors nonetheless aim their\

films at an inner world, a world of psychology, of faith, of imagination. This course looks at a range of topics\
associated with cinema's inner space: cinema as dream, outer space as inner space, the reading of interior\
space. Films are drawn primarily from the European art cinema, although some Hollywood, independent,\
and experimental films from the United States also serve as examples. Directors may include Deren, Lynch,\
Hitchcock, Godard, Bresson, Fassbinder, Fellini, and Tarkovsky. Prerequisite(s): one course in English.\

ENGS 395Q Reading Feeling: Literature and Affect Theory\
What does it mean to recognize the body as affectable? How might this recognition inform our\
understanding of power? How has affect contributed to the study of literature, and how might literature\
contribute to the study of affect? Students read literature of various genres side-by-side with the development\
of "affect theory." They trace the tendrils of feeling and emotion to some foundational roots in philosophy,\
psychology and psychoanalysis, and cognitive science, but the focus is on the affect theory that develops out\
of feminism, queer theory, and women of color- and queer of color-critique. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level\
English course. Recommended background: ENG 296.\

AFEN 395T African American Literary Issues and Criticism\
This seminar takes as its premise that black literature engages with and reflects parts of the world in which it\
is produced. In this course, students sort through the various conversations authors and critics have with each\
other. They read canonical authors and less well-known figures in an effort to tease out the nuance present in\
this body of work. Each text is paired with another in a form of dialogue. These exchanges are not set, so it is\
up to students to understand how the texts speak to each other. Literary criticism requires us to think\
through privilege, citizenship, capitalism, intraracial dynamics, gender and sexual dynamics, and political\
movements. The course theme may vary from year to year (e.g., disability, literature of the left, black queer\
studies).\

ENG 395Z Curb Your Enthusiasm: Mockery, Irritability, and the Satire of Feigned Performance, 1600-\
2100\
Searching the past 500 years of British stage comedy, do the roots of bigotry and prejudice, as identified in\
contemporary comic performance, announce themselves? Is there a line from Shakespeare\'92s, Jonson\'92s, Behn\'92s\
comedies; eighteenth-century comedy of manners; Victorian philosophical satire; Wilde\'92s exaggerated\
speech; Beckett\'92s flatness; Orton\'92s outrageousness to the contemporary snarky comedy of Fawlty Towers, Key\
and Peele, and Curb Your Enthusiasm? Is religious imposturing, a complaint of seventeenth-century writers\
such as Spinoza against the clergy's case for belief in miracles, a probable source for the highly theatrical\
practice of feigning? Early modern theater, no less than subsequent theater, has seized on religious hypocrisy\
to provide material for comedy. To understand the social processes - the mechanism of action - of such\
migration, the seminar explores and contextualizes theatrical practices of mockery, irritability, and satire.\

ENG S10 International Cinema in the 1960s\
The 1960s saw the rise of "new wave" cinemas across the world; not only the French new wave, but also the\
Czech, British, Japanese, and Hungarian new waves brought youth, energy, and sometimes political rebellion\
to the screen. The auteurs of the European art cinema (Godard, Antonioni, Bergman) made films that were\
as intellectual and as challenging as any classic novel. This course introduces students to formal and\
ideological film analysis through a survey of key international films from the 1960s.\

ENES S16 Minding Birds: Culture, Cognition, and Conservation\
What are the consequences of minding birds, in several senses (caring for them, being bothered by them,\
endowing them with faculties of intellect and emotion, or simply believing that they have minds of their\
own)? This course invites students to take birds seriously as thinking, feeling neighbors by examining literary\
representations of birds from antiquity to the present alongside recent ornithological studies. Three distinct\
units focus on separate families: hawks, crows, and sparrows. Students venture outside to record field notes\
on local species in each of these groups, and compare their findings to representations in literary and\
scientific texts. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English course.\

ENG S20 Queer Thought, Queer Insurgency\
Queer theory provides a critical method that complements intersectional feminist approaches to literature\
and visual culture by analyzing the construction and regulation of gender and sexuality through social, legal,\
and medical norms of embodiment and identity. This course explores canonical queer critique in relation to\
the early history of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, an era in which the radical currency of the term "queer" links\
scholarly, activist, and artistic responses to the AIDS crisis and its homophobic cultural politics. Students also\
consider present-day LGBTQ+ scholarship, literature, and art to explore the insurgent visions and worldmaking\
projects that animate queer thought today. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English course, or GSS 100.\

ENES S26 Overstories: Telling the Lives of Trees\
Who tells the stories of trees, how do they tell them, and why? How are the lives and voices of forests\
captured and constructed? Students in this course address these questions by examining a range of novels,\
histories, and scientific studies focused on trees and forests, and by constructing their own narratives --\
fictional and/or historical -- about their lives with trees, including those on the Cheltenham campus and in the\
surrounding community. They consider how trees and forests have been identified by writers as models for\
human beings and human communities. Students hear from those who work with trees, including foresters\
and arborists, and consider the ways in which the lives of trees and those of human beings are intertwined.\
Readings include Richard Powers, The Overstory; John Fowles, The Tree; Lauren Oakes, In Search of the\
Canary Tree; and Peter Wohlleben, The Secret Lives of Trees. Prerequisite(s): ENVR 205 or one 100-level\

An introduction to the study of print cultures and the history of the book by closely examining one type of\
printed text, poetry. Students consider how the invention of the Gutenberg press and developments in\
printing practices began to influence poets, before tracing the relationship between print technologies and\
poetic practices up through the present day. The class read widely, studying: Tottel's Miscellany (the first\
printed anthology of English poetry), George Herbert's image poetry (1633), William Blake's illuminated\
Songs of Innocence and Experience (1789), and the 20th- and 21st- century concrete- and pattern-poetry\
movements, including poetry by Augusto de Campos, Guillaume Apollinaire, e e cummings, Mary Ellen\
Solt, Marilyn Nelson, Tyehimba Jess, and Jen Bervin. Students also compose their own poetry and\

students write four creative nonfiction essays in the genres of memoir, lyric, travelogue, and art review.\
Students learn to see writing as an act, not as a product. To that end, the course includes workshops in which\
ideas and critiques of writing assignments are thoughtfully offered. To further fuel the writing assignments\
and workshops students read a wide-ranging selection of creative nonfiction essays, studying figurative\
language, character and setting development, and dramatic structure.\

Environmental Studies\
Environmental studies encompasses a broad range of issues that arise from the interaction of humans with\
the natural world and built environments. To understand these issues, students must think across and\
beyond existing disciplinary boundaries. The environmental studies major provides a framework for students\
to examine how humans experience, investigate, and interact with the world around them. The curriculum\
includes interdisciplinary course work that encourages students to explore the social, aesthetic, ethical,\
scientific, and technical aspects of environmental questions and to approach these questions with more\
focused knowledge and methodological tools through a major concentration.\
More information is available on the Environmental Studies program website.\

ENES 121Q The Lives of Rivers\
In this colloquium, students read broadly-from the magical waterways of classical antiquity to the American\
folk tradition that takes us "down by the riverside"-in order to better understand the human need to write\
about rivers. Students consider verse by Whitman, Walcott, and Spark alongside Twain's stories of\
Huckleberry Finn and the classic angling novella A River Runs Through It. From the local riparian zone on\
the banks of the River, students follow contemporary currents of ecocritical inquiry, investigating\
moments when the landed human body is literally or figuratively swept away by a torrent of fresh water.\

ENVR 124 Managing the Gulf: Climate Change and Impacts on Coastal Communities\
The Gulf, due to its oceanography and other factors, has historically supported the harvesting of\
abundant marine resources, such as groundfish, lobster, and shellfish. Climate change is, however, leading to\
considerable environmental change with warming waters, increasing ocean acidification, and sea level rise,\
forcing communities to adapt existing resource management, reconsider location of coastal structure, and\
make way for new uses of the Gulf, such as aquaculture and energy production. This\
interdisciplinary course draws on oceanography, ecology, history, economics, anthropology, and political\
science to explore these pressures on the marine environment\'92s impact on coastal economies. Through\
lectures, discussion, readings, and field trips, students explore the social and ecological dimensions of\
managing fisheries and aquaculture with a focus on the Gulf.\

The environmental crisis is profoundly political. This course familiarizes students with some of the major\
social scientific contributions to understanding how and why environmental problems arise, how they are\
defined, and how different groups are affected by and respond to them. The course first outlines the\
contemporary world system in which environmental debates take place and then identifies drivers of\
environmental change. Students then apply these ideas to a variety of ongoing environmental controversies,\
including climate change, agriculture, urbanization, biodiversity conservation, pollution, and environmental\
justice.\

ENVR 205 Lives in Place\
What does it mean to live sustainably in place? This course investigates possible answers to that question by\
considering lives in place: particular stories, particular places, and multiple forms of storytelling about\
human relationships to the more than human world. From nature writing to poetry, memoir, documentary,\
film, and the novel, humans (the "storytelling animal") demonstrate ways of living that enable us to reflect\
on the virtues, values, vices, and trade-offs of those lives. Keystones in this consideration include modernity\
and tradition, technologies of change, voices and points of view, animal agency, eating as agricultural act,\
consumption, and creativity. Students consider both classic and emerging texts and artists from a variety of\
periods and cultures, examples of humans' ongoing experiment in living on Earth.\

Year after year of unprecedented flooding, fires, and heatwaves: the climate crisis of the future is now.\
Governments, NGOs, scientists, entrepreneurs, communities, and individuals across the world are now\
confronted with the climate crises in variable and uneven ways. The drivers of climate change and how\
humanity responds to climate impacts each engender matters of climate (in)justice. This course explores the\
ways in which the uneven distribution of climate harms and benefits are deeply linked to structural\
inequalities along axes of race, class, gender, and nationality. Through engagement with case studies and\
social movements, topics such as sacrifice zones, environmental racism, climate gentrification, green\
grabbing, disaster capitalism, climate apartheid, and climate displacement are explored. Finally, students\

ENVR 301I Farm, Food, and Factory: An Environmental History of the Industrial Food System in the\
United States\
Food as one of the most basic human needs has generated incredible efforts to shape the environment.\
Beginning in the nineteenth century, innovations that applied principles of industry to food production have\
resulted in an unprecedented availability of food. But nonhuman organisms have resisted complete\
commodification again and again, and have shaped the U.S. and global food system in return. From the\
vantage point of the United States and the region in particular, this seminar explores how humans linked\
agriculture, labor, science, technology, industry, empire, and global trade and development into a powerful\
industrial-agrarian system that feeds us today.\

ENVR 301M The Region: Environment and History\
This course introduces students to the region history from its beginnings to the twentieth century,\
emphasizing the region's most pervasive theme, the environment. From aboriginal people to European\
colonists, different people have relied on the region's natural resources. Indeed, the environment shaped\
the region's most prevalent industries. By the twentieth century, the region emerged as a popular\
vacation destination, causing many to reflect on conservation efforts. This seminar explores the significance\
of locality in understanding the interaction between the environment and different people through time.\
Students develop a deeper sense of place in our community.\

ENVR 304 Politics of Nature\
What is nature and what does it mean to say that it has a politics? In one common understanding, nature is\
precisely that which stands apart from political dynamics, indicating a world of objective "facts" beyond\
human influence. Yet the concept of nature has long been implicated in relations of power, whether by\
making certain social relationships such as race, gender, and class seem inevitable or by lending strength to\
movements for liberation. This course examines the politics of nature through various lenses of\
poststructuralist, postcolonial, feminist, and Marxist political theory, ultimately seeking to imagine how\
nature itself might become a site for transformative democratic practice. Prerequisite(s): two of the\
following: AN/ES 242; ENVR 203, 204, or 205; ES/PL 214; ES/PT 272; GS/PL 262; GSS 100; PHIL 150 or 211;\

BIES 306 Disturbance Ecology\
Many ecosystems have a long evolutionary history of being adapted to natural disturbances such as wildfire,\
insect outbreaks, and drought. These disturbance processes are required for such systems to persist. On the\
other hand, anthropogenic disturbances\'97nuclear disasters, invasive species, oil spills\'97can have profound\
effects on systems that are not evolutionarily prepared for them. In this course students examine the effects of\
natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecological systems and discuss whether climate change is\
increasing disturbance severity. Students are introduced to concepts of disturbance probability and risk, and\
the complexities of conveying this information to the general public. Prerequisite(s): one of the following:\

This course investigates the deep historical roots of China's contemporary environmental dilemmas. From\
the Three Gorges Dam to persistent smog, a full understanding of the environment in China must reckon\
with millennia-old relationships between human and natural systems. In this course students explore the\
advent of grain agriculture, religious understandings of nature, the impact of bureaucratic states, and the\
environmental dimensions of imperial expansion as well as the nature of kinship and demographic change.\
The course concludes by turning to the socialist "conquest" of nature in the 1950s and 1960s and China's\
post-1980s fate.\

ENVR 322 Mountains and Modernity\
Once regarded as impenetrable barriers dividing Europe, the Alps and Carpathian Mountains were\
transformed into international meeting places with the arrival of mass tourism in the late nineteenth\
century. At the same time, these mountain ranges began to be claimed in the constructions of national and\
ethnic identities that reshaped Central and Eastern Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. The\
course examines the role ascribed to the Alps and Carpathians at a pivotal time in European history, when\
the demise of empires and rising nationalism, but also new ideas about class, gender, ethnicity, and race,\
fundamentally restructured dynamics of power on the continent. Recommended background: a 200-level\
course focused on the study of literature and/or film in any department.\

relations shape differential access to and control over resources? What makes people more or less vulnerable\
to environmental changes? Through a selection of historical and contemporary topics and case studies from\
across the United States, the course explores how political, economic, and cultural forces shape\
environmental inequalities and how, in trying to address those inequalities, various groups challenge and\
broaden the assumptions and practices of modern environmentalism. Prerequisite(s): ENVR 204.\

ENVR S20 The Future of Food\
This course considers how novelists, filmmakers, chefs, activists, and political theorists have imagined the\
future of food in a warming world. From works of science fiction predicting the "meal-in-a-pill" to "slow\
food" manifestos by chefs who call for us to think globally but eat locally, the course explores cultural visions\
of our culinary futures. Will the future of food be marked by transformative technologies or a return to\
ancestral traditions and local food economies? Students explore these questions in conjunction with a weekly\
bread baking "lab" in which they learn the basics of making sourdough using region-grown grains.\
Prerequisite(s): ENVR 205 or one course in English or rhetoric, film, and screen studies. This course is not\

ENES S26 Overstories: Telling the Lives of Trees\
Who tells the stories of trees, how do they tell them, and why? How are the lives and voices of forests\
captured and constructed? Students in this course address these questions by examining a range of novels,\
histories, and scientific studies focused on trees and forests, and by constructing their own narratives --\
fictional and/or historical -- about their lives with trees, including those on the Cheltenham campus and in the\
surrounding community. They consider how trees and forests have been identified by writers as models for\
human beings and human communities. Students hear from those who work with trees, including foresters\
and arborists, and consider the ways in which the lives of trees and those of human beings are intertwined.\
Readings include Richard Powers, The Overstory; John Fowles, The Tree; Lauren Oakes, In Search of the\
Canary Tree; and Peter Wohlleben, The Secret Lives of Trees. Prerequisite(s): ENVR 205 or one 100-level\

European Studies\
The Program in European Studies reinforces the college's mission to engage students in intellectual discovery\
and informed global citizenship. European studies is a multifaceted interdisciplinary program that broadens\
students' understanding of the region and encourages them to question assumptions about Europe's role in\
the world. Courses offered in European studies (EUS or EU) are taught in English.\
The establishment of the European Union and the intricate processes of negotiating national identities are\
recent and contentious steps toward greater political, economic, and cultural collaboration. At the same\
time, national politics, cultures, histories, sports and entertainment, arts, economies, and languages continue\
to play a role in defining what Europe is today and what it will become in the future.\
The contemporary complexities of European history, society, politics, and languages can only be fully\
understood by transcending disciplinary boundaries. Courses offered by a variety of departments and\
programs provide a rich resource for European studies and ensure an interdisciplinary approach to cultural\
texts and their sociopolitical contexts.\
More information is available on the European Studies program website.\

Course Offerings\
EUS 101 Introduction to Europe\
This course introduces students to major themes in European studies, considering the dynamic processes by\
which Europe and European identities have been defined since the cold war. Students examine, among other\
questions, how Europe has changed in the wake of new economic and political realities, with the formation\
of international organizations, and in the face of shifting ethnic, religious, and cultural landscapes. By\
investigating these topics from various perspectives, students gain the interdisciplinary tools to understand\
the intricacies of an ever-changing Europe.\

EUS 104 Revolutionary Europe and Its Legacies, 1789 to Yesterday\
This course examines European revolutions and their legacies\'97social, cultural, political, and ideological. The\
French Revolution of 1789 brought unprecedented promises of reform to old Europe. Yet it also brought\
terror and authoritarian rule, a cycle that seemed to repeat itself, "the first time as tragedy, the second as\
farce," as Karl Marx lamented. Students consider these revolutions together with the Communist uprisings\
waged in Marx's name, the "velvet" revolutions of 1989, and the populism that engulfs the continent today.\
They use these histories as lenses to understand the dynamics of modern revolution; the engagement of\
ordinary Europeans in these processes; and, not least, the making of modern Europe over the past 300 years.\

EURU 111 Protestors, Punks, and Pioneers: Youth in Eastern Europe\
This course examines the role of youth and student culture in shaping East European societies in the\
twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Course materials including film, literature, journalism, and music\
provide an introduction to East European cultural and social history and encourage students to explore\
themes of identity, activism, expression, and community. As students move from considering the role of\
youth in the Russian Revolution to contemporary student protests in support of human rights, class\
discussions bring new perspectives to the ways young people both navigate and foster change in the times\
and spaces they occupy.\

EUS 112 Gangsters and Gulags: Crime in Russia and Eastern Europe\
This course explores the history and shifting contexts of crime and punishment in Russia and Eastern Europe\
from the nineteenth century to the present. Central questions for the course include how crimes against the\
state, against property, and against individuals differ; how gender, religious, and ethnic identities impact\
ideas about criminality; and how legality and morality are related. As students explore literary texts, firstperson\
narratives, films, and other media depicting crime and criminals, they discuss what kinds of norms\
and values are reinforced or undermined by ideas and actions surrounding crime.\

EUHI 206 The Empire Strikes Back: The Ends of European Empires in the Twentieth Century\
In 1918, Woodrow Wilson famously outlined his Fourteen Points, emphasizing the right of subject peoples\
to self-determination. While Wilson's was hardly the first critique of empire, it provided a framework for\
increasingly organized anti-colonial movements. Just as European empires reached their zenith, older\
rationales for empire became harder to maintain. Yet the end(s) of European empires were long in the\
making. Many would argue that we have yet to live in a postcolonial world. This course explores the\
changing arguments over the future of European empires, the contests for power, and their effects on\
individuals' lives across the globe.\

prospects. Will Europe grow closer together or further apart? What are the trade-offs between "social" and\
"market" models of integration? What are the impacts of enlargement? What is the future of the Eurozone?\
Does the E.U. promote regional nationalism, e.g., in Scotland and Catalonia? Why did Britain decide to\

EUHI 245 Race, Gender, and Power in the Early Modern Atlantic World\
This course approaches Atlantic history through the lens of race, gender, and power. In the early modern\
world, the Protestant Reformation, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the rise of the plantation complex, the\
substantial depopulation of west and central Africa, and indigenous genocide in the Americas significantly\
reshaped social orders and the meaning of the most salient categories of difference. This course examines the\
imposition of these categories from above and how socially marginalized groups pushed back against\
colonial racial, gender, and sexual economies throughout the Atlantic world and in particular societies,\
including Mexico, Virginia, Barbados, Ghana, and the Congo.\

The course engages students with Putin\'92s Russia through cinema and discusses a European culture that is, at\
the same time, non-Western in its political make up. Topics discussed include the colonial center and its\
contemporary political and cultural ambitions, imperial periphery and Russia\'92s "quiet others," the Russian\
Idea in New Auteurism, Putin\'92s blockbusters, Russia\'92s alterities (minorities, sexualities, taboo Russia), Global\

A topical survey of Slavic culture as realized in a number of social institutions including the family, the\

imagined communities and the unities and disunities that shape the identities of Europe's largest language\
family and the peoples who occupy more than half of the European continent.\

EUS 281 Upstairs, Downstairs, and Outside: Gender, Class, and the Household in British History\
If the home was the \'93Englishman\'92s castle,\'94 its walls were porous. Liberal culture insisted upon separating\
private from public life, yet households were key sites for negotiating classed, gendered, and racial\
relationships. Fear that family units might break down spurred social movements and governmental reform.\
Modern life tends to be understood as the rise of the presumptively white, male individual, someone\
independent of his surroundings. By flipping the script, this course demonstrates the centrality of women,\
family, and community in defining and redefining society. Topics explored include work, motherhood,\
property rights, and the everyday life of politics, capitalism, and empire.\

EUHI 288 Modern Russia: From Revolution to Today\
Nearly thirty years have elapsed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Still, the history of the world\'92s first\
socialist state continues to inform the political and social development of modern Russia and Eastern\
Europe. This course explores this history from the revolution(s) of 1917 to the collapse of communism and\
the rise of Putin. It traces the country\'92s myriad transformations from Lenin\'92s New Economic Policy, to\
Stalin\'92s "Revolution from Above," to Gorbachev\'92s Glasnost and Perestroika. Throughout the course, students\
focus on the lived experiences of Soviet citizens to gain an appreciation of what it meant to live through\
these profound transformations.\

murder of Jews, Roma, Sinti, homosexuals, Communists, and the handicapped. Students trace the escalation\
toward the "Final Solution" and the importance of World War II in the implementation of the Holocaust.\
Using a variety of sources, students learn about everyday life within the Third Reich and in occupied Europe.\
Among the topics considered are the motivations of German and non-German perpetrators, bystanders, and\
collaborators. New course beginning winter 2020.\

EUS 301R Freedom of Speech, a Modern History\
Free speech has long been a rallying cry of reformers and a centerpiece of modern, liberal constitutions.\
Despite its centrality, free speech has never been absolute. Dictators fear it, but it troubles more democratic\
societies, too. Words can destroy personal reputation and fan racial or religious hatred. This seminar\
examines the long history of free speech and its limits. Students focus on the United Kingdom and United\
States, drawing connections and comparisons with other European, colonial, and postcolonial accounts. The\
course foregrounds historiographical inquiry, research, writing, and the ever-critical use of history to\
understand the present, and vice versa.\

an instrument in political lobbying, and the deepening significance of money in contemporary political\
discourse. How did money and debt become instruments of power and coercion? To what extent and how\
does money influence politics and vice versa? How are money and financial institutions regulated at the\
national level? How is international finance governed? What are the economic and social impacts of public\
debt? Does finance undermine democracy?\

conduct sustained reading of foundational texts in political economy, including works by Adam Smith, Karl\
Marx, Karl Polanyi, and Friedrich Hayek. What have these texts yet to teach us about both historical and\
contemporary political economic dilemmas? Recommended background: prior course work in the\

and anti-elitist positions. They have enjoyed electoral and other successes in Europe, Latin America, North\
America, Asia, and Africa. This seminar examines the causes of their rise, nature of their rhetoric and\
policies, and profound impact on cultural, political, economic, and other social processes and dynamics.\

1948. While the USSR claimed the monopoly on Marxism, Yugoslavia constructed its image as an\

introduced a more democratic, "West-friendly" socialism. The course also examines changing concepts of\
gender, sex, and dissident cultures, via texts and films produced on the eve of socialism\'92s collapse in the early\

The European Union (E.U.) represents one of the most remarkable achievements of the contemporary world.\
This seminar first reviews the history and structure of the E.U. It then examines a series of topics related to\
the political, social, and geographical dimensions of European integration. These topics include the drivers of\
integration, the transformation of domestic policies and institutions, the demands of E.U. law, the rise of a\
European identity, the consequences of expansion in Eastern and Central Europe, the salience of regions, and\
the E.U. on the international scene. Comparisons with other trade blocs conclude the seminar. Students are\
exposed to numerous theoretical tools and methodologies, including institutionalism, rational choice theory,\
intergovernmentalism, and comparative methods. Prerequisite(s): one course in sociology or politics, or EUS\

EUS 322 Mountains and Modernity\
Once regarded as impenetrable barriers dividing Europe, the Alps and Carpathian Mountains were\

century. At the same time, these mountain ranges began to be claimed in the constructions of national and\
ethnic identities that reshaped Central and Eastern Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. The\
course examines the role ascribed to the Alps and Carpathians at a pivotal time in European history, when\
the demise of empires and rising nationalism, but also new ideas about class, gender, ethnicity, and race,\
fundamentally restructured dynamics of power on the continent. Recommended background: a 200-level\
course focused on the study of literature and/or film in any department.\

examines how the stories that groups tell themselves about themselves help construct, justify, or contest\
relations of power within the group or between themselves and others. It also asks how such memories can\
be used to overcome the traumas and conflicts of the past. Specific cases are drawn from a variety of different\
countries, including the United States. Prerequisite(s): one 100- or 200-level politics course.\

migration, while also recognizing that Europe has encountered such crises before, with disastrous outcomes\
for the whole world.\

EUS S33 Central European Theater and Politics\
A study of Hungarian and Czech history, politics, and theater since about 1945. Our focus is on the impact\
on theater of the cataclysmic social and political changes in Central Europe since the Hungarian uprisings of\
1956. Other seminal events bearing on this study are the Prague Spring of 1968, the collapse of the Soviet\
bloc in 1989, and the subsequent rebuilding of politics and culture in the region up until today. In\
conjunction with our study of history, politics, and drama, students read an array of secondary sources on the\
social and cultural history of post-war Central Europe. Classes will be conducted as discussions, led by the\
Cheltenham instructors and Hungarian, Czech, and other Central European artists and scholars. Students maintain\
a journal describing and analyzing the plays, readings and other academic materials studied. Recommended\
background: one course in European studies, theater, or politics.\

FYS 318 Through the Eyes of Children\
Is the experience of childhood universal or culturally specific? What do children from diverse Frenchspeaking\
countries have in common? Children are often the least "acculturated" members of any particular\
society. What can we learn about culture from a child's perspective? These questions are probed by exploring\
childhood in a number of French-speaking countries and communities. Students examine (in English) a\
selection of narratives and films from the French-speaking world that feature the points of view of children.\
The course not only considers the ways in which narrative and film present childhood experiences in specific\
cultures, but also explores perspectives on issues such as family structure, sexual and gender orientation, child\
abuse, and colonialism.\

do-it-yourself ethic as a defining impulse in contemporary musical culture, informing the democratic\
amateurism of punk, the "found sound" innovations of the experimental avant-garde, and the collage\
aesthetic of the digital "mash-up." Students explore Lawrence Lessig's Creative Commons, with its challenges\
to copyright law, and engage with the work of John Cage, Bikini Kill, Brian Eno, the Raincoats, M.I.A., and\
Girl Talk, among others.\

between the United States and the Middle East over the last two centuries. How have American perceptions\
of the Middle East changed over time? How has U.S. involvement influenced state formation, regime\
consolidation, and people's daily lives in the region? What were the major successes and failures of American\
foreign policy in the region? Students explore these questions through a variety of sources, including\

Paella, bullfights, flamenco, castles, the Inquisition, Roma, and tapas. For over two centuries such images of\
Spanish culture have filled the American imagination and have inspired a variety of travelers, from Romantic\
poets to civil rights activists, foodies to film directors, to hit the road to Spain. Through the study of food,\
music, literature, journalism, film, and television, this course looks at the ways in which Spain, as a real and\
an imagined destination, has figured in shaping individual and collective identities on this side of the\
Atlantic. Issues related to travel and tourism, the activities of recording travel experiences, and the ways in\
which notions of race, gender, and nation determine the travelers' encounters with Spain frame discussions\
of course materials and provide a foundation for written and oral assignments.\

The twentieth century casts a long shadow over Eastern and Central Europe: two world wars, ethnic\

victims, villains, heroes, collaborators, and cowards. Efforts to make sense of this history, even after all these\
years, remain a topic of intense political debate. This course examines historical writings, films, and\
monuments to explore the politics of memory in Eastern and Central Europe, with particular attention paid\
to Germany, Poland, and Russia. Why does historical memory of these events continue to have such\

This controversial book explores the July 1941 massacre of Polish Jews by their non-Jewish neighbors in the\
small town of Jedwabne during the Nazi occupation. The play raises a question of national collective\
memory in the aftermath of World War II. Students study the historical events on which the play is based,\
and examine the dramatic structure of the text in the aspects of staging.\

Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994 after more than three centuries of white\
dominance. Today, he is considered the greatest African leader of the twentieth century. This popular\
perception, born of Mandela's charisma after walking out of jail and becoming president, cuts out many\
actors and events in the history of South Africa. This course introduces students to these obscured actors and\
events. It begins by exploring the encounter between Europeans and Africans, then examines the\
institutionalization of the apartheid state, and concludes by studying the reactions to, and defeat of, the\
apartheid state.\

This multidisciplinary course explores the origins and iterations of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the United\
States from 1866 to the present. In so doing, the course makes larger claims about the core relationship\
between the white power movement and the making of "America." Drawing on the concepts, paradigms,\
and intellectual traditions of American cultural studies and Black studies, students consider the shifting\
narratives, contested ideologies, and the regional and temporal convergences and divergences of the KKK\
from its violent founding to our contemporary moment. Students learn how to theorize the KKK through\
frameworks that prioritize the concepts of racialization, patriarchy, cultural hegemony, resistance,\
citizenship, and counterrevolution.\

Japan has created some of the most vibrant films in the world. Breathtaking animation, playful comedies,\
samurai epics, and groundbreaking silents are all a part of Japan's cinema output. But many students leave\
high school with a media diet dominated by Hollywood. What can we learn by studying a country's movies\
from outside that country? How can studying Asian film help break unnoticed patterns of bias in media\
consumption? This introduction to film studies centers on five prominent Japanese films by major directors.\
Students learn how to read films beyond narrative, acquiring skills for formal film analysis. Taught in reverse\
chronological order, students encounter films by greats such as Kurosawa Akira and Ozu Yasujir\uc0\u333 . Readings\
and assignments consider questions of the auteur, film form, film history, and the place of film in Japanese\
society. Mid-week meetings are set aside for in-class film screenings and advising .\

FYS 507 Lewiston: A Local Lens on Global Issues\
Sometimes the best way to answer big questions is to look for answers on a local scale. This course engages\
with debates on topics such as immigration, economic development, sustainable agriculture, environmental\
degradation, and racial inequities in the legal system by taking a closer look at the city\
community and its rich history. Students learn tools of historical inquiry by seeking the roots of present-day\
challenges in the past, while also developing skills to work across difference through community-engaged\
learning activities.\

FYS 511 Information is Physical: From Classical to Quantum Computers\
The natural sciences and computing have long been intertwined disciplines. This connection is deeply\
established although not always readily apparent: first, in that computing is a fundamentally physical\
process, something in and of nature and not merely abstract; second, in that the evolution of our universe\

according to the laws of physics is itself a kind of computation; and third, in that much of scientific progress\
now is wholly dependent on computing infrastructure. In this course students learn about the history of\
computing machines, and how this has culminated in our ubiquitous networked devices and the recent\
development of rudimentary quantum computers. Students read historical nonfiction on the history of\
computing, and explore new ideas in recent computing research. Computational work of their own as well\
as written work help students clarify and communicate their ideas on the subjects, including their own\
relationship to technology.\

FYS 532 Arts and Spirituality: Art Making and Aesthetic Experience as Conduits for Reflection and\
Connection\
In this seminar, students explore the ways in which art making and aesthetic experiences facilitate reflection\
and instill connection to whatever one holds as sacred. They examine art practices from a variety of world\
religions and secular spiritual traditions, hear from current artists about their spiritual lives, learn to engage\
with art intentionally, and participate in many centering creative practices together. No previous artistic\
experience is necessary as this course focuses on the process of creating rather than the creation itself.\

FYS 533 Paperfolding: A Blend of Art, Mathematics, and Engineering\
From the ubiquitous paper crane to hyperbolic surfaces to space telescopes, origami has exploded in the last\
fifty years. Origami continues to inspire artists who have moved well beyond birds into fantastically complex\
creations involving hundreds of folds. It has brought together scientists, mathematicians, artists, teachers,\
and engineers. In this course, students learn basic paper folding techniques to create simple origami designs.\
Then they use these designs to delve into the world of mathematics, from using origami to trisect an angle to\
exploring the Cut and Fold Theorem. Students also look at some of the folds that have led to applications in\
design and engineering. Finally, they consider the work of artists who have taken origami into high art, and\
investigate how origami is being used in the world of education.\

FYS 536 Great Expectations: Making and Remaking a "Classic"\
How does a "great" novel come to be, and how does our sense of its worth and limitations change over time?\
What factors - personal, cultural, material - lead to its creation and recreation? Students examine Charles\
Dickens's 1860-1861 novel in its original, weekly format, consider its immediate contexts, its alternative\
endings, and its recreations in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, in such works of fiction as Peter\
Carey's Jack Maggs (1997), Lloyd Jones's Mr. Pip (2006), and Ronald Frame's Havisham (2012), and in film\
adaptations. In the process, they consider the changing significance of a Victorian "classic."\

Originality, a concept undergoing varying descriptions and likely socially constructed, is frequently linked to\
creativity and as being defined as the first appearance of an idea. "Inventing Originality" focuses on late\
eighteenth-century romanticism as the possible historical beginning of the concept. The seminar next\
examines originality - how expressed by imitation in classical, medieval, and early modern texts. Then,\
querying twentieth and twenty-first century literary experimentations in poetry and fiction, it especially\
attends to Baudrillard's simulacrum, Dadaist poetry, and postmodernist efforts to randomize thought.\
Finally, the seminar studies originality in the context of group teamwork, especially by those practicing\
accessibility and inclusion\

FYS 538 The Chemistry of Dyes, Drugs, and Dams\
Throughout history, around the world, humans discovered plants and animals capable of synthesizing dyes\
and used these compounds to dye fabric. Interestingly, these dyes and the techniques used to make them\
served as the basis for many pharmaceuticals and drugs still on the market. In this course students explore\
the chemical structures of textiles and dyes to investigate the chemical basis of color, the ways light and\

Humans seek out aesthetic experiences; these experiences can be beautiful, engaging, appetizing, or moving.\
Indeed, such experiences are so important to us that we are willing to invest a lot of time and money into\
them. But why? What\'92s the point of any of this? This course takes up these questions by thinking about the\
aesthetic significance of film, food, and games. Students engage with what philosophers have written on\
these subjects while viewing particular films, making food, and playing games.\

This course explores how children\'92s literature mediates the experiences of migrants and refugees; how it\
constructs national, ethnic, racial, gender, and other identities; and how it advances or challenges the\
European ideal of "unity in diversity." Students critically examine how children\'92s books depict flight and\
migration; the identities, needs, and aims of migrants and refugees; the roles of European societies in global\
conflicts; the negotiation of difference; and the possibilities and limits of intercultural understanding. They\
also consider whose experiences are highlighted or ignored and, crucially, who gets a voice in the lucrative\
children\'92s book market.\

FYS 541 This Land Is Whose Land?\
The region is renowned for its public lands, whether national parks like X or smaller parcels owned and\
managed by local nonprofit land trusts. But what does it mean that these are Indigenous places? This course\
explores how Native peoples have long contested their expulsion from the "public" lands that Americans\
have created through colonization. Students learn how X -- the collective name for the Native\
peoples of the region -- are working to regain rights to their\
homeland. Much of this work is occurring in partnership with local land trusts, which are largely run by\
non-Natives. Students may have the opportunity to work with some of these groups to support their efforts\
to decolonize Native places. One or two required field trips off campus are scheduled on a Saturday;\
students with weekend commitments should consider this schedule when registering.\

its institutional growth in the twentieth century, theories of development, and the different actors involved.\
Drawing heavily on case studies and voices from across the global South, the course then explores major\
environment-development quandaries such as extractive industry, large infrastructure projects, public health,\
food security, disaster relief, and foreign aid, all the while measuring them against development\'92s shifting\
aspirations: poverty alleviation, social justice, and sustainability.\

changed the ways people interact with religious sites \'96 especially in Asia - and what does this mean for\
religion and travel in the twenty-first century? How have people written about religious travel over time? This\
course explores the relationship between tourism, pilgrimage, and colonial histories through reading and\
writing about these topics in the context of modern Buddhist Asia. Students discuss three writing genres\
(ethnographic account, travel memoir, and academic article) and explore the components of each, while\
learning to write in these styles.\

Why are some people willing to sacrifice to improve the well-being of strangers? How can we motivate others\
to engage in prosocial behavior? Is cooperation always a good thing? In this course, students engage in both\
the study and the practice of prosocial behavior through lectures, multidisciplinary reading selections, class\
discussion, service to others, and a range of assignments designed to explore different ways of knowing and\
communicating. Students examine prosocial behavior through research questions, methodologies, and\
findings from economics, psychology, neuroscience, sociology, anthropology, evolutionary biology,\
environmental studies, and political science.\

FYS 546 Why War?\
What causes wars? Conversely, what prevents war, why do many crises end without war? Given the great\
costs of war to civilians, soldiers, and societies, why do states take the leap into the unknown? War\'92s\
consequences extend well beyond the battlefield, transforming societies and changing governments and\
borders. Over the last decades, civil wars have become frequent, but wars between states still trouble many\
regions and colonial wars have had persistent effects. A central question is the extent to which wars are the\
purposeful, rational pursuit of policy, the result of misperception, or the result of seemingly inexorable forces\
over which there is little control. Students examine the leading theories, their key concepts and causal\
variables, and the causal paths leading to war or to peace. They also consider the degree of empirical support\
for various theories and hypotheses. Students study a range of texts and write a range of papers, including a\
final research paper.\

Once relegated to the fringe of society, conspiracy rhetoric has moved to the center of political and public\
discourse in the United States. This course examines the narratives, argumentative structures, and functions\
of conspiracy rhetoric. Students examine an array of conspiracy theories - both real and fictional - to critique\
the work that conspiracy theories do for the individual and communities to understand the role of language\
and visual media in creating and defining reality. In addition, students create texts in various media to\
elevate discourse in the public sphere around fake news and conspiracy theories.\

While terms like genderqueer, nonbinary, and cisgender have gained increasing public attention, they often\
travel without attention to the ways that gender norms, ideals, and privilege depend on matters such as race,\
ability, sexuality, and settler colonialism, as well as on resources for gender expression and selfdetermination.\
Using examples from diverse areas, including fiction, poetry, visual media, art, and sport, this\
course focuses on the interworkings of queer gender and race, including how those interworkings might\
factor into our writing practices.\

This course explores conceptualizations and representations of race and gender in health and medicine.\
Students begin by looking at the history of race, sex, and sexuality in Western science, especially in terms of\
how they have been articulated through multiple contexts involving infectious diseases. How does scientific\
thought and practice intersect with larger political and economic movements including colonization and\
imperialism? Then they discuss the uses of race and sex in contemporary biomedicine focusing on the\
following questions: How is inequality "written on the body"? How are categories of risk and susceptibility\
racialized and biologized? How are racism and sexism considered "underlying conditions" that powerfully\
shape whether or not people contract infectious diseases and who lives and who dies? The course focuses on\
global health disparities.\

writing. They read and discuss examples of effective storytelling, with particular emphasis on identifying\
audience and intent. They analyze how different authors present personal stories and community concerns,\
as they refine composition techniques and grammar fundamentals to more effectively express their own. As\
critical thinking skills evolve, writing skills improve.\

French and Francophone Studies\
Courses in French and Francophone studies help students to learn basic communication skills, appreciate\
other cultures through language, and go beyond the study of language to achieve a deeper understanding of\
diverse peoples by way of their literatures and other modes of cultural production. Texts and film are\
analyzed closely from a contemporary critical perspective with attention to their cultural and historical\
context. All courses are taught in French, except in the case of some courses cross-listed with other\
departments or programs, which may be taught in English.\
French and Francophone studies aims at flexibility within a structure that affords a diversity of experience in\
Francophone culture and literature and continuous training in the use of the language. It provides effective\
preparation for graduate work but is not conceived as strictly preprofessional. The significance of French is\
highlighted by the college's proximity to Qu\'e9bec and by the large number of Franco-Americans and new\
regioners from African countries who live and work in the region. In addition to France's literary\
tradition, the Francophone histories and cultures of North African countries, West Africa, the Caribbean,\
and Qu\'e9bec have produced writers and artists who have influenced the world broadly with their cultural and\
artistic dynamism and insight, making French and Francophone cultural production a truly rich and varied\
platform to explore gender, sexuality, race, religion, and nationality.\
More information is available on the French and Francophone Studies department website.\
Major Requirements\
The major in French and Francophone Studies consists of a minimum of 10 courses beyond the level of\
Intermediate French (201).\
1. French Courses Above Intermediate French\
Complete at least 9 French courses above Intermediate French (201).\
These courses should reflect both geographical breadth and historical depth; students must consult with\
a faculty member when planning the course of study in the major.\
Two courses in a related discipline may normally count as one of the 10 courses in the major; one of the\
two may be taught in a language other than French.\
2. Senior Seminar\
Complete at least one 300-level French Seminar.\
All majors are required to take at least one 300-level seminar in the senior year.\
3. Capstone\
All senior majors are required to complete a capstone experience that serves to synthesize and reflect\
upon their work in the major as described below:\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\

Return to Table of Contents\
The Capstone Experience\
Fluent and correct use of the language is essential to the completion of the major. All senior majors are\
required to complete a capstone experience that serves to synthesize and reflect upon their work in the major\
as described below:\
1) All majors must assemble a portfolio of their work in the major and discuss it at the end of the second\
semester of their senior year. The portfolio contains a personal statement on the student's experience in\
French and Francophone studies and other components such as papers from courses taken at Cheltenham or\
abroad, a journal of a study-abroad program or travel experience, audio and/or video recordings to show\
progress in oral proficiency, websites that may have been created for courses or other Francophone\
endeavors, or other personal reflections. After submission, majors schedule a soutenance or discussion of the\
portfolio (normally 20-30 minutes in length), which takes place with all members of the faculty in French\
and Francophone studies.\
2) All majors must complete one of the following, all of which fulfill the [W3] requirement. Some portion of\
any of these options must be included in the portfolio for discussion:\
a) a senior thesis (457, 458), which may be one-semester, two-semester, or honors. The thesis represents a\
sustained, scholarly work in the discipline, written in close consultation with a faculty member from the\
department.\
b) a senior essay, an extracurricular (noncredit) written work that treats a question in the field of French and\
Francophone studies as agreed upon by the student and faculty advisor. The senior essay is significantly\
shorter than a one-semester thesis, yet still involves research and inquiry into a topic using tools of literacy\
and cultural study as practiced in the discipline.\
c) an oral history project, which consists of a series of interviews with Francophone interlocutors, which are\
transcribed, edited, and presented at the Mount David Summit, and archived at Cheltenham and in local\
repositories. These documentary projects, beyond interviewing, recording, and editing, entail an extended\
reflection on the process and an analysis of the final product.\
3) All majors participate in a regularly scheduled Atelier de recherches in which they discuss approaches to\
research in French and Francophone cultural studies and their progress in the capstone requirements,\
including presentations of their research.\
Honors candidates register for both FRE 457 and 458.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Advanced Placement courses may not count toward the major. Students majoring in French and\
Francophone studies are strongly encouraged to study abroad in a country appropriate for their area of\
interest. Normally majors receive a maximum of three credits for one semester of study and five credits for\
two semesters of study in a recognized program. Normally, minors receive a maximum of two credits for one\
semester of study and three credits for two semesters. Students must obtain approval from the department\
chair in order for their course to count toward major or minor in the discipline; otherwise, credit is not\

Pass/Fail Policy\
No courses beyond FRE 235 may be taken Pass/Fail for credit toward the major.\
Minor Requirements\
A minor in French and Francophone studies requires a minimum of seven courses. At least one of the seven\
courses must focus on literature or culture beyond the 235 level, or its equivalent. Advanced Placement\
courses may not be applied toward the minor. All students who minor in French and Francophone studies\
must assemble a portfolio of their work in the minor. The portfolio consists of samples of written course\
work and is designed to demonstrate progress in the study of the French language as well as acquisition of\
analytical skills to interpret cultural production and socio-historical practices.\
Minors are requested to work closely with their official advisor on the compilation of the portfolio which is\
due at the beginning of the Short Term of their final semester. There is no defense ("soutenance") or\
presentation of the portfolio as is the case with majors.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\

thinking in French with attention to written expression. In addition to reading short essays by French and\
Francophone theorists, students acquire specific conceptual vocabulary to analyze films and explore\
questions of language, power, and privilege; constructions of gender, national, and racial identities; and their\
intersectionalities.\

FRE 240F Borders and Disorders\
A study of the various experiences of immigration that the Francophone world has made possible and, in\
certain cases, forced upon people for political and economic reasons. In an era of globalization, students\
examine how increasingly migrants must negotiate their sense of self through multiple heritages and places,\
and how Francophone novels and films imagine new forms of belonging that embrace the complex and fluid\
status of the migrant experience. How does one define "home" within one's host country without denying\
one's past and cultural origins? The course envisions the Francophone world as a theater of multiple\
encounters that lead to the creation of new hybrid identities that transform both the immigrant and the host\
country. Authors and filmmakers include Bouchareb, Bouraoui, Cond\'e9, De Duve, Flem, Gomis, Guibert,\
Nacro, Sebbar, Semb\'e8ne, and Zang. Prerequisite(s): FRE 207, 208 or 235.\

What kind of unique knowledge does a documentary film seek to offer? What are the strengths and the limits\
of this genre in our increasingly visual culture? Does the documentary impulse bring us closer to the "reality"\
of which it takes the pulse? Does it force us to face the existential and political practices it makes socially\
visible? How do documentary films, in comparison with historical fictions or novels, position their viewers\
and call for social engagement? Moreover, to what extent are documentary films able to renew our vision of\
postcolonial history and memory and confront issues of power, priviledge, and the diversity of views and\
beliefs? This course examines these topics through the works of several French and Francophone\
documentary filmmakers. Prerequisite(s): FRE 240 or 250.\

Gender and Sexuality Studies\
The Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies analyzes local and global entanglements of knowledge, power,\
pleasure, and resistance. Drawing on histories of antiracist, decolonial, feminist, queer, and trans work,\
courses examine shifting dynamics of privilege, exclusion, and marginalization. The program also cultivates\
action, practice, and reciprocal engagement with the many communities of which we are part. To study\
gender and sexuality in these ways is to refute simple assertions about identity in favor of richly detailed\
accounts of the specific conditions through which particular social positions are maintained and\
transgressed. Students may choose to either major or minor in gender and sexuality studies.\

feminist scholars and activists and encounter modes of critical and liberatory theorizing that productively\
challenge notions of what constitutes theory. Additionally, students practice ongoing self-reflection, or\
awareness of their own positionality and the ways it affects their journey through the course.\

discourse, and relations among them. Topics include the reach into the lives of all athletes of gender\
binarism and gender segregation; the regulation of transgender, gender nonconforming, and intersex\
athletes, including through the delineation of those categories, in the context of other discourses around\
human variation in sport; the roles of raced masculinities, femininities, heteronormativities, and\
homonormativities in the valuation of athleticism, athletes, and sports; and issues from pleasure to pinkwashing.\

CMGS 204 Classics and the History of Sexuality\
This course investigates how the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome has shaped many of our\
contemporary ideas on sexuality in the United States. Students explore the role of Greco-Roman material in\
discourses of sexual identity, freedom, and oppression from the first scientific studies of sexual behavior in\
the late nineteenth century to notions of sex, gender, and sexuality in the modern day. Throughout the\
course, students analyze texts from both ancient and modern contexts to see how classical culture has acted as\
an explanatory force in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and politics. Students also explore how\
marginalized groups, especially LGBTQI peoples, have used Greco-Roman antiquity as a means both for\
forming community and for arguing their equal rights.\

GSS 205 Queer Indigenous Studies\
This course examines the complex intersections of Indigenousness and queerness within the prevailing\
context of colonialism. Students investigate experiences at the nexus of LGBTQ+ and Indigenous cultural\
identities and expressions. What do we mean by \'93queer\'94? What do we mean by \'93Indigenous\'94? How have the\
relationships between queer Indigenous peoples-like the muxe (Zapotec), Two-Spirit (North American), or\
fa\'92afatama (Samoa)-and their respective communities changed? How are queer Indigenous social movements\
distinct from general LGBTQ+ social movements? Through theoretical essays, personal narratives, film,\
fiction, and poetry, students consider a range of cultures to comprehend the global impact of colonization on\
Indigenous genders and sexualities and recognize ongoing decolonial movements for reclamation.\
Recommended background: one course on the study of gender, sexuality, queer studies, and/or trans studies.\

GSS 206 Gender Traditions and Transformations in the Americas\
Beginning with a survey of traditional Indigenous gender systems across the Americas, this transdisciplinary\
course examines changes over time in the concepts and contexts of gender normativity and nonconformity\
from precolonial eras through the present. Students explore topics ranging from the meaning of \'93gender\'94\
and \'93the Americas\'94 to settler colonialism and peoplehood, from #MMIWG2S (Missing and Murdered\
Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two Spirit people) to Black trans feminisms, from surveillance and state\

and historical context and its subsequent interpretation and use in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions.\
Special attention is given to the ways in which the biblical texts have been interpreted and used to imagine,\
promote, and justify social orders - both hierarchical and egalitarian - as well as how the construction of\
gender relations links to the ways in which other social institutions are articulated and justified. Topics\
include the creation of the cosmos, characterizations of the Creator, the origins and perfection of humanity,\
the origins of evil, and the nature of the garden.\

questions that challenge the simplistic binaries of woman/man and sex/gender; trace the Euro-Western\
conceptualization of \'93transgender\'94 with critical attention to the elision of non-Euro-Western\
conceptualizations; and investigate the development of transgender studies as an academic field distinct from\
queer studies. What impact have pivotal political and legal changes and social movements had on the lived\
experiences of transgender and gender-expansive people, in particular those who are multiply marginalized\
by such factors as race, socioeconomic class, citizenship, and ability? How are these lived experiences\
reflected in the scholarship of the field? Recommended background: one course on the study of gender\

and sexuality, especially Michel Foucault's controversial thesis on ancient sexuality. Students examine ancient\
philosophy, rhetoric, poetry, graffiti, novels, and visual culture to discuss the lived experiences of Roman\
people, whether gladiators, senators, sex workers, or matrons. Special attention is paid to the diversity of\
experiences recorded outside of canonical texts, and the influence of foreign cultures on Roman thought and\

GSPT 219 Social Movements in Latin America\
Social movements have often played key roles in Latin American politics. In the 1980s, grassroots movements\
against dictatorships raised hopes that poor and marginalized groups might spur processes of\
democratization and development. In the new democratic regimes, however, significant social and economic\
inequalities persist, marking political and social space in acute ways. This course explores the struggle by\
poor and marginalized groups for space, both theoretically and literally, through examination of rural\
landless movements, urban squatter movements, LGBT movements, and women's movements in the region.\

minorities take more than one spouse, interact with aliens, or stockpile weapons for the end of the world?\
This course explores common characteristics of minority religions and considers how gender and sexuality\
have shaped beliefs, practices, and popular depictions of American minority religions since 1945. Students\
examine writings and speeches of charismatic leaders, consider radical religious innovations, and analyze\
popular culture portrayals (including films, graphic novels, and fiction) of minority religions in the post-\

What is gender? What is race? What is oppression? What does it mean to experience discrimination or\
oppression? Feminist philosophy uses philosophical methods to think carefully about gender, the way gender\
intersects with other identities, the lives of historically marginalized voices, and the concepts employed in\
feminist political movements and similar social movements such as those centered around race, class, sexual\
identity and orientation, and disability. Additional areas of study may include science and society; gender\
and science; sex and sexuality; reproduction; family; gender in popular culture; and the body and appearance.\

GSS 273 US Immigration: From the "Uprooted" to the Rise of the Immigration Regime\
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" encapsulates the belief that\
the United States is a nation of immigrants, yet that can be an oversimplification of a deeply complex issue.\
This course explores the various reasons people migrate, acculturate, and what it means to be an "American"\
and an immigrant. Students review immigration records to examine how issues of poverty, sexual\
orientation, gender, race, and political affiliation affected how people "breathe free" and navigated the US\
immigration regime from the late-nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries.\

GSS 281 Upstairs, Downstairs, and Outside: Gender, Class, and the Household in British History\
If the home was the \'93Englishman\'92s castle,\'94 its walls were porous. Liberal culture insisted upon separating\
private from public life, yet households were key sites for negotiating classed, gendered, and racial\
relationships. Fear that family units might break down spurred social movements and governmental reform.\
Modern life tends to be understood as the rise of the presumptively white, male individual, someone\
independent of his surroundings. By flipping the script, this course demonstrates the centrality of women,\
family, and community in defining and redefining society. Topics explored include work, motherhood,\
property rights, and the everyday life of politics, capitalism, and empire.\

and historicize sex and sexuality in the three centuries prior to this moment. Can we see the traces of identity\
in sexual desire in early modernity? How is sexual desire related to gender? To race? To class? To other\
intersectional identities? What might it mean to queer an early modern text? And how do literary genres\
from the period \'96 poetry, drama, prose \'96 enable the exploration of these questions? Recommended\

affect change in the North American context, and how is this different from the Buddhist past? The course\
draws on a variety of sources, including literary, cinematic, and visual materials, to answer these questions.\
Special attention is given to how gender is presented in doctrinal texts, and the (dis)connection between\
these documents and the lived experiences of Buddhist people, as presented in interviews and\
autobiographies by Buddhist practitioners from a variety of moments and communities.\

GSS 312 Transgender Narratives\
Many transgender and gender-expansive authors have written about navigating the experiences of childhood,\
coming out, transition, passing or not passing, or not trying to pass, and living within a cis-normative society.\
What is compelling or relatable about these narratives? Are there similar patterns or arcs among them? How\
do these differ from the trans experiences depicted by cisgender authors? Using memoir, blogs, vlogs, prison\
letters, interviews, poems, and diary entries, students examine the narratives that transgender and other\
gender-expansive people construct and present about their experiences. This interdisciplinary course\
considers the telling of one\'92s own story and the impetus to do so for people embodying marginalized\
genders, especially those who are multiply marginalized by such factors as race, socioeconomic class, ability,\
citizenship, and place. Recommended background: one course on the study of gender, sexuality, queer\

intersectional relationship between LGBTQ+ people, theory, anthropology, and economics by \'93queering\
capitalism\'94. Students engage ethnographic accounts of LGBTQ lives and films and representations of\
cultures and economy in media that point to the significant relationship between queerness and capitalism.\
We look at capitalisms queer relationships and formations often \'93under the covers\'94 in mainstream economic\
anthropology to investigate the role of heteronormativity in studies of the family, kinship, relationships, and\
sexuality in global capitalist contexts. We then look at ethnographic accounts - stories and studies of everyday\
lives - that challenge our taken-for-granted views and \'93queer\'94 our understandings of capitalism.\

AVGS 345 Trans Studies in the Politics of Visibility\
Many people have welcomed the increased visibility of trans and/or gender-nonconforming people as a sign\
of progress. Yet who is visible, what constitutes visibility, and whom do particular visibilities benefit? This\
course uses a trans studies framework to consider both the products and the politics of visibility. Topics\
include the representation of queer gender and trans and/or gender-nonconforming people in contemporary\
visual culture; critiques of visibility in relation to state surveillance and white supremacy; and the\
interconnected roles of norms regarding race, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and ability in perceptions and\
practices of gender normativity and transgression. Recommended background: at least one course with\

AMGS 353 Critical Theory/Critical Acts\
Critical theory unravels streams of repressive discourses and hierarchies in our contemporary world, and\
artists have fostered ruptures and fissures in everyday life. This seminar ponders the concept of "cultural\
worker" and laments the domain of theory by exploring the intersections between critical theory, art, and\
cultural politics. Students engage in the ruptures, the fragments of knowledge, and making sense of the\
residue of "social change" while not forgetting the problematization of the aesthetic. They consider U.S.-\
based interdisciplinary artists such as Thiong'o, Fusco, Ana Mediata, Tania Bruguera, David Hammon, Jay-Z,\
Pope.L, and Lady Gaga with critical theorists such as Fanon, Butler, Foucault, Phalen, Mu\'f1oz, Moten,\
Adorno, Barthes, Olkowski, and Benjamin. This seminar is based on close readings of theoretical texts and\
connecting those texts with contemporary cultural politics.\

The depiction of Africa in Western media is often negative, dealing mostly with civil conflicts, epidemics,\
lack of resources, and human rights abuses. While these certainly remain a reality, they provide a limited\
perspective. This course strays away from such preconceptions and examines issues surrounding women in\
Africa, including political participation, conflict, women\'92s rights, and civil society. Students having taken\

GSS 391M Rhetorics of the Body: Intersections of Identity, Power, and Culture\
Bodies are profoundly rhetorical: they compel audiences to act, think, and be in the world differently.\
Rhetoric is also profoundly embodied: rhetorical messages are articulated through bodies that exist at the\
intersection of various dynamics of identity and power. As both vehicles and artifacts of rhetoric, bodies hold\
the power to reveal, maintain, and disrupt the underlying beliefs, norms, and values of a given culture. This\
course explores the relationship between the body and rhetoric, including how bodies communicate\
rhetorical messages as well as how broader discourses enable, constrain, and define bodies in particular ways.\

Grappling with gender and species at once, this course considers two concepts that have enforced binary\
thinking about what defines and divides human life. Reaching back to medieval and early modern literature,\
students examine representations that push against received formulations of man/woman and\
human/animal. How have categories of gender and species reinforced one another in figurations of living\
bodies and their experiences? Can we liberate our reading from either of these binaries? What are the\
promises of such a liberation? Readings include theoretical interventions from animal studies,\
posthumanism, queer and transgender theory, and ecofeminism. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English\

What does it mean to recognize the body as affectable? How might this recognition inform our\
understanding of power? How has affect contributed to the study of literature, and how might literature\
contribute to the study of affect? Students read literature of various genres side-by-side with the development\
of "affect theory." They trace the tendrils of feeling and emotion to some foundational roots in philosophy,\
psychology and psychoanalysis, and cognitive science, but the focus is on the affect theory that develops out\
of feminism, queer theory, and women of color- and queer of color-critique. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level\

The contemporary turn toward more authoritarian rule in the Global North has aroused intense popular and\

however, ignores both longer histories of enslavement, captivity, and colonization, and the complex\
connections between shifting forms of governance and gendered relations of power and resistance. This\

Yugoslavia\
Was socialism and socialist art a uniform phenomenon across the USSR and Eastern Europe? The course\
focuses on the development of socialist cultures in the USSR and Yugoslavia following the Tito-Stalin split in\

introduced a more democratic, "West-friendly" socialism. The course also examines changing concepts of\
gender, sex, and dissident cultures, via texts and films produced on the eve of socialism\'92s collapse in the early\
1990s.\

Hispanic Studies\
Spanish is a cross-national and global language. It is the second language of the United States, and the first\
language of over 400 million people in Latin America, Europe, and Africa. It is a vehicle for myriad cultural\
expressions that find audiences far beyond its traditional trans-Atlantic axis to Asia and the Pacific, and it has\
given voice to struggles for social justice that have echoed around the world.\
The Department of Hispanic Studies responds to the cultural richness and diversity of the people who speak\
Spanish as well as to the obligations and opportunities of a globalized world through a threefold mission:\
1) the department enables students to acquire a strong and useful proficiency in Spanish that allows them to\
navigate cultural spaces in which over 400 million people interact worldwide;\
2) the department fosters the development of interpretative skills and contextual knowledge to engage\
critically a broad range of cultural productions originating in the Spanish-speaking world;\
3) the department contributes to the study of the humanities through a curriculum of courses taught in\
Spanish that includes studies of Latin American, Spanish, and U.S. Latinx literature, media, and visual arts,\
covering an array of historical periods and informed by diverse and varied theoretical approaches.\
More information is available on the Hispanic Studies department website.\

HISP 224 Protest and Justice\
At different times and in different countries, many writers, filmmakers, and other artists from the Spanishspeaking\

gender, and class. In this course students analyze these "texts" within their respective social, political, and\
historical contexts. Prerequisites(s): HISP 210 or 211. Not open to seniors.\

political, and cultural issues and 2) the processes, through study of different theoretical and aesthetic\
approaches, creators use to adapt works from one mode to the other. Through the analysis of literary and\
audiovisual productions from Latin America, Spain, and the United States, students engage the theoretical,\
technical, and practical debates among institutions, producers, and consumers that emerge in the process of\

set the tone for ongoing debates on the processes of coloniality. Through period texts, students consider\
debates on intellectual autonomy; regional and national identities; and the rights of indigenous people,\
African descendants, and women in the new nations of the nineteenth century. The course ends with an\
emphasis on literatures that explore divergent gendered, sexual, racial, and political viewpoints. The course is\

HISP 231 Readings in Spanish Literature\
What are the points of convergence and divergence between Spain and Europe? How has Spain articulated\
itself as European? How and by what motives has Spain emphasized its differences vis-\'e0-vis Europe? In this\
course, students consider these questions by reading representative literary works by Spanish writers from all\
periods in light of the European context in which they were crafted. Students pay special attention to how\
broad, sweeping historical processes that stand as markers of European identity, such as wars, revolutions,\
and cultural and philosophical movements, are reflected in Spanish literature. Central themes include\
religion and expansion, modern monarchies and the making of the "people," the invention of the nation and\
the ideal citizen, and postcolonial disorders. Prerequisite(s): HISP 210 or 211. Not open to seniors.\

In recent years, film and literature from across the globe have been increasingly interested in childhood\
experiences and perspectives. Contesting popular beliefs that childhood is an innocent and apolitical\
experience, Latin American film and literature have depicted the child figure both as a complex, agentic\
character and as a site of tension for issues of race, class, gender, and national politics. This course\

ASHS 303 Phillippine Literature in Spanish\
This course interrogates the status of the Spanish language and literature written in Spanish in the\
Philippines from 1873 to 1945. Through the study of foundational works by the late nineteenth-century\
Ilustrados, it explores how Spanish came to be a vehicle for movements of resistance and rebellion against\
400 years of Spain\'92s colonial domination of the archipelago. In novels, poetry, and essays by writers of the socalled\
Golden Age, it examines how Spanish persisted under the U.S. colonial occupation (1898-1945) to\
contest the imposition of English and Anglophone culture, and to cultivate a sense of Filipino nationhood\
alongside literary revivals of indigenous languages such as Tagalog, Cebuano, and Chavacano. Readings\
include works by Pedro Paterno, Jos\'e9 Rizal, Jes\'fas Balmori, Adelina Gurrea and Mar\'eda Paz Mendoza, among\
others. Only open to juniors and seniors. Prerequisite(s): one 200-level Hispanic studies course beyond 211.\

The course explores antipatriarchy and anti-imperialist poetry written by women in twentieth- and twentyfirst-\
century Spanish America. It grounds its exploration on historical writers such as Sor Juana In\'e9s de la\
Cruz and Micaela Lastenia Larriva, who wrote against the gender paradigm brought to the Am\'e9ricas by the\
Spanish. It closely examines the work of Rosario Castellanos and Domitila Barrios Ch\'fangara and the\
transition from antipatriarchy to anti-U.S. imperialism, and the presence of poetry as a weapon in defense of\
civil liberties. Special attention is given to contemporary poetry written by indigenous and Afro-descendant\
women of the Spanish-speaking Am\'e9ricas. Prerequisite(s): HISP 211.\

The course introduces students to the growing "presence" of Latinx poetry. It acquaints students with the\
interdisciplinary approaches used in translation such as postcolonial, humanistic geography, linguistic\
anthropology, cultural and literary studies. The course addresses the racial and ethnic enunciations\
embedded in lyrical expression while exploring the experience of place, and the linguistic landscape being\
created by bi/trilingual poets. Critical thinking, transcultural dialogue, and auditive intuition are elements\
used in the process of translation. In addition, students document their individual processes of translation\
from English to Spanish in blog-style format, as well as present their work in dialogic-workshop format.\

The contemporary Spanish American novel that engages historical political violence does so from an\

recognizable but revised forms of fiction to accommodate voices in tension, while a cohesive plot shapes and\
allows for the questioning of memory placement and the articulation of trauma. Contrary to the \'93gran\

HSLL 341 Lectura americana de Cervantes\
A present-day reading in America of Don Quijote de La Mancha and other key texts of the Spanish and\
Spanish American Renaissance. This course examines themes of Islamophobia, white supremacy, conquest\
and empire, the slave trade, the quest for utopias, and the construction of historical narratives that shape the\
politics of the day. Students analyze myths and legends of the marvelous real such as the fountain of youth in\
Florida, the island of California, the return to the Golden Age, fabulous cities and unbelievable real ones\
(Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Cuzco) that are admired and destroyed, and a fake island in Louisiana called Barataria.\

war, gender roles and women's freedom, mental and physical disability, and changes to the environment in\
the form of windmills. Taught in Spanish. Prerequisite(s): one 200-level Hispanic studies course above HISP\

the increasing popularity of fictional representations of this armed conflict, its political antecedent (Segunda\
Rep\'fablica), and its consequence (el r\'e9gimen de Francisco Franco). What is the role of these narratives? What\
do they say about the roots of Spanish democratic traditions? How do they negotiate conflict? What type of\
Spain do they propose? Prerequisite(s): HISP 210 or 211.\

HISP 390 Afro-Latinoamerica\
The 500-year presence of Africans and their descendants in the Spanish-speaking world has produced a\
significant body of literature by Blacks and about Blacks. Spanish America was the main destination of the\
African diaspora. Writers of African descent attest to the struggle for freedom and the abolition of slavery as\
well as anti-colonialism. Their literature shows how the participation of Blacks in the wars of Latin American\
independence was a struggle for their emancipation. Afro-Hispanic writers in Spain, the Americas, and Africa\
use their art and ideas to address the postnational migrations of the twenty-first century, a diaspora that has\
not ceased. Recommended background: AFR 100. Only open to juniors and seniors.\

HISP S14 Science, Public Health, and Humanistic Inquiry: Travel, Medicine and the COVID-19\
Pandemic in Chile\
This course explores the intersection of natural scientific and humanistic inquiries in the context of Chile's\
public health system and its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of biomedical science in Latin\
America is approached through the lens of travel as both a practice and metaphor for understanding\
encounters with other societies as a peril of infection and contagion. How scientific problem-solving\
produced anti-virus transmission protocols and vaccines and how interactions between travelers and host\
societies during a global pandemic expose conflicts of socioeconomic interests and human welfare provide\
the context and foundation for on-site examinations of the public health response and self-reflection in\
Chile. Students engage with local biomedical and public health researchers, healthcare providers, and\
cultural practitioners, and visit relevant cultural and historical sites to understand how scientific and\

HISP S51A Race and Nation in the Iberoamerican World\
This course fosters a critical understanding of racial paradigms that have endured and morphed over\
centuries. The course is based on close readings of documents (essays, visual texts, and historical documents)\
that serve as the origins of racial and racialized discourse. Particular emphasis is placed on racial capitalism\
and the ways in which this paradigm undergirded the Spanish and Portuguese empires and continues to\
sustain the exploitation of Black and Brown bodies throughout the Iberoamerican world. The course takes\
account of how concepts such as "blood purity," mestizaje, Indigeneity, and Blackness inform\
understandings of nationhood throughout the Iberoamerican world. Prerequisite(s): HISP 205 and 210 or\
211. Recommended background: one 200-level or 300-level course in Hispanic studies or from abroad.\

History\
History has been defined as the collective memory of things said and done, arranged in a meaningful pattern.\
Such knowledge of the past supplies context, perspective, and clarity in a diverse and changing world. The\
members of the history department offer widely differing views of the history of a broad variety of peoples,\
yet they agree that the study of the past provides meaning in the present and informed choices for the future.\
The study of history teaches an appreciation of both change and continuity, the critical examination of\
evidence, the construction of arguments, and the articulation of conclusions. In addition to teaching and to\
graduate studies in history and law, majors find careers in related fields such as work in museums and\
archives, public service, indeed any profession requiring skills of research, analysis, and expression.\
Courses in the history department are designed to be taken in sequence: first, introductory survey courses\
(100-level), then more specialized intermediate courses (200- and 300-level), and ultimately advanced\
seminars (301). While nonmajors are welcome in any history course, all students are encouraged to begin\
their study of history with 100-level courses.\
More information is available on the History department website.\
Major Requirements\
1. Knowledge Track\
Majors should develop a depth of knowledge within a particular field of history that can be defined in terms\
of geography or chronology. They choose a track from one of the below fields of study.\
Complete one of the following tracks:\

d. Latin American\
Complete at least one course designated with the (History: Latin America) attribute.\
e. United States\
Complete at least one course designated with the (History: United States) attribute.\
3. Seminar\
Complete one course from the following:\
\'95 Any HIST 301 seminar course\
Majors must take a 301 seminar during their sophomore or junior year and before studying abroad.\
4. Methods\
Complete the following course:\
\'95 HIST 399 Historical Methods\
Majors must complete HIST 399 in the semester prior to writing their thesis.\
5. Senior Thesis\
Complete at least one course from the following:\
\'95 HIST 457 Senior Thesis\
\'95 HIST 458 Senior Thesis\
Senior history majors write a thesis in the fall (HIST 457) or winter semester (HIST 458). Thesis writing\
develops the skills learned in previous courses and demonstrates the ability to work independently as a\
historian. To facilitate thesis planning and advising, all majors must complete a thesis proposal\
(information available on the department's website) before taking either HIST 457 or HIST 458.\
Ordinarily, students should be on campus the semester prior to writing the senior thesis.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Majors must take a minimum of eight history courses from Cheltenham faculty members. This means that students\
may use a maximum of two credits taken elsewhere (transfer or off-campus study courses) toward the major\
requirements, subject to department approval. To request that an external course count toward the major or\
minor, students should submit a copy of the syllabus to their academic advisor, preferably before they\
register for the external course. To be eligible to count for department credit, the course should include\
material beyond lectures and exams, including some combination of outside reading assignments and\
substantive written work that includes instructor feedback. Advanced Placement credits, awarded for a score\
of four or five on the relevant examination, may count toward overall college graduation requirements but\
do not count toward the history major or minor.\

Short Term Courses\
Not more than one Short Term course may count toward the major.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for courses applied toward the major.\
Other Considerations\
Each spring, the department invites outstanding junior majors to become candidates for graduation with\
departmental honors. There are three principal advantages to this program for the qualified student: first, the\
two-semester schedule, with two course credits, allows more time for the maturation of the project and\
grants twice the academic credit for the related research and writing; second, the mutual understanding of\
the honors candidate and the thesis advisor that the completed work is to be presented to other interested\
readers also contributes to an enhanced relationship and a shared commitment that it be brought to a\
satisfactory conclusion; third, the quality of this relationship and of the completed work can inform much\
more substantive letters of recommendation, based on the student's demonstrated competence, discipline,\
and independence, the personal characteristics most sought by professional schools and potential employers\
alike. Departmental invitees must discuss proposed topics with the preferred advisor before the beginning of\
the academic year. They must produce sufficient written work of sufficiently good quality by the end of the\
fall semester of the senior year to justify formal nomination by the history department to the college's honors\
committee. They must also present their work to a faculty panel, including an outside examiner, at the end of\
the winter semester in an oral defense.\
Minor Requirements\
The minor in History consists of at least six courses, five of which must be taken from Cheltenham faculty members.\
1. 100-Level Course\
Complete at least one 100-level History course.\
2. 300-Level Course\
Complete at least one 300-level History course.\
3. Knowledge Breadth\
Complete at least one course grounded in African, East Asian, or Latin American history.\

CMHI 101 Introduction to the Ancient World\
A study of the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome, this course is the introduction to European history\
in the Department of History and is a fundamental course in the Program in Classical and Medieval Studies.\
It addresses themes and events extending from the eighth century B.C.E. until the second century C.E.\
Students consider the disciplines that comprise study of classical antiquity, engage with primary texts\
(literary, graphic, and epigraphical), and learn how ancient history has come to be written as it has been.\

HIST 102 Medieval Worlds\
Far from being an "enormous hiccup" in human progress, the medieval centuries (ca. 350-1350) marked the\
full emergence of Islamic, Byzantine, and West European civilizations. These powerful medieval cultures\
shape our present. The central theme of this introductory survey course is the genesis and development of a\
distinct Western European medieval civilization including its social, economic, political, and cultural\
aspects. Important topics include the devolution of the Roman Empire; the Christianization of the West; the\
origins of the Byzantine world; the rise of Islam; and the history of medieval women.\

HIST 104 Revolutionary Europe and Its Legacies, 1789 to Yesterday\
This course examines European revolutions and their legacies\'97social, cultural, political, and ideological. The\
French Revolution of 1789 brought unprecedented promises of reform to old Europe. Yet it also brought\
terror and authoritarian rule, a cycle that seemed to repeat itself, "the first time as tragedy, the second as\
farce," as Karl Marx lamented. Students consider these revolutions together with the Communist uprisings\
waged in Marx's name, the "velvet" revolutions of 1989, and the populism that engulfs the continent today.\
They use these histories as lenses to understand the dynamics of modern revolution; the engagement of\
ordinary Europeans in these processes; and, not least, the making of modern Europe over the past 300 years.\

AFHI 105 Africa: Special Topics in African History, 1500-1900\
For many observers, the history of Africa begins with European colonization. What about the period prior to\
colonization? This introductory survey of African history from 1500 to 1900 covers the social, political,\
cultural, and economic life of sub-Saharan peoples. Topics include African kingdoms, the transatlantic and\
the Indian ocean slave trades, the expansion of European power after the abolition of the slave trade, Islamic\
reforms, and the spread of Christianity. The course not only introduces students to a range of historical\
events in the continent, but also highlights how some of these events shaped other parts of the world.\

HIST 107 Race Reception and the Modern Creation of the Ancient and Medieval Past\
This course is designed to introduce students to the ways in which the study of the classical and medieval\
worlds has been constructed alongside, and as an integral part of, modern systems of colonialism, racism and\
white supremacy. It aims, likewise, to introduce students to the ways in which the distant past, so\
constructed, continues to inform the contemporary world, both as a locus of oppression and of resistance.\
The course will, therefore, present students with the tools necessary to understand and critique these fields of\
study, as well as help them to more critically view the way they understand the past and the present.\

HIST 140 Origins of New Nations, 1500-1820\
In the three centuries after Europeans' and Africans' first arrival among indigenous Americans, a variety of\
peoples from America, Africa, and Europe constructed new societies in North America. Some of these new\
societies became nation-states like the United States and Mexico. Others, like the British, Iroquois, and\
Kongos, were reconfigurations of societies that predated the beginnings of colonization. All of them were\
collective efforts to manage new dynamics of confrontation and cooperation. These new nations were shaped\
by a number of factors, including empires and families, liberty and enslavement. By examining a variety of\
sources, students learn how a host of peoples created a new world that has strong ties to our own..\

and confronted the forces that shaped a restless nation: slavery, capitalism, patriarchy, expansionism,\
urbanization, industrialization, and total warfare. Whether fighting for recognition or resisting the\
encroaching state, they struggled over the very meaning of American nationhood. The outcome was\
ambiguous; its legacy is still being contested today.\

attention is directed to the impact of war, corporate globalism, and movements for change upon the\
development of an increasingly complex, variegated modern society confronting the paradox of\
simultaneous social segmentation-by race, class, gender, ethnicity-and cultural homogenization. Students\
consider the disjunction between Americans' democratic ideals and their administered reality and what can\

EUHI 206 The Empire Strikes Back: The Ends of European Empires in the Twentieth Century\
In 1918, Woodrow Wilson famously outlined his Fourteen Points, emphasizing the right of subject peoples\
to self-determination. While Wilson's was hardly the first critique of empire, it provided a framework for\
increasingly organized anti-colonial movements. Just as European empires reached their zenith, older\
rationales for empire became harder to maintain. Yet the end(s) of European empires were long in the\
making. Many would argue that we have yet to live in a postcolonial world. This course explores the\
changing arguments over the future of European empires, the contests for power, and their effects on\
individuals' lives across the globe.\

The Vikings were the most feared and perhaps misunderstood people of their day. Savage raiders branded as\
the Antichrist by their Christian victims, the Vikings were also the most successful traders and explorers of\
the early Middle Ages. The Viking Age lasted for three centuries (800 - 1100 C.E. ), and the Vikings' world\
stretched from Russia to North America. Study of the myth and reality of Viking culture involves materials\
drawn from history, archaeology, mythology, and literature.\

perspective on the nation's social history. Specific topics include Europeans', Africans', and Native\
Americans' competing efforts to shape the colonial environment; the impact and changing understanding of\
disease; the relationship between industrial environments and political power; and the development of\
environmental movements.\

HIST 216 Conflict and Community in Medieval Spain\
Medieval Spain was a crossroads where the civilizations of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism met, mingled,\
and fought. Diverse and dynamic societies emerged, and from this climate of both tension and cooperation\
came a cultural and intellectual flowering that remains a hallmark of human achievement. Using a wide\
range of primary sources, this course focuses particularly on two key concepts in Spanish history: the\
Reconquista and the Convivencia. To examine these, students investigate the nature of conflict in medieval\
Spain and the ways in which those who lived there constructed and understood their communities.\

HIST 220 The Medieval Year\
This course explores daily life and community in the Middle Ages through festivals, holidays, and marking\
the passage of the seasons. First, students are introduced to the format of both the natural and ritual year,\
and how individuals and groups responded to environmental factors. Second, they consider the role of such\
seasonal rituals as a means of creating social cohesion and coercion. Medieval festivals and holidays were not\
just fun: they frequently sought to impose specific visions of social and religious order on participants (and\
those who were excluded). Third, students reflect on how holidays and communal rituals still have power to\
shape community, identity, and belonging in contemporary society. The course helps students learn about\
medieval religious and cultural practices in a critical manner; while focusing on Christian traditions, they\
also consider Jewish and Muslim customs in a broader European context. Recommended background: prior\
coursework on the pre-modern world.\

HIST 241 The Age of the American Revolution, 1763-1800\
A study of the American Revolution from its origins as a protest movement through the aftermath of the\
War for Independence from Britain. Because the War for Independence transformed American society, the\
course examines debates among Americans over the meaning of the Revolution and the nature of society in\
the new republic. The course considers the significance of the Revolution for Europeans and Latin\
Americans as well.\

AMHI 244 Native American History\
A survey of Native American peoples from the centuries just before European contact to the present, this\
course addresses questions of cultural interaction, power, and native peoples' continuing history of\
colonization. By looking at the ways various First Nations took advantage of and suffered from their new\
relations with newcomers, students learn that this history is more than one of conquest and disappearance.\
In addition, they learn that the basic categories of "Indian" and "white" are themselves inadequate for\
understanding native pasts and presents. Much of this learning depends on careful readings of Indigenous\
American writers.\

EUHI 245 Race, Gender, and Power in the Early Modern Atlantic World\
This course approaches Atlantic history through the lens of race, gender, and power. In the early modern\
world, the Protestant Reformation, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the rise of the plantation complex, the\
substantial depopulation of west and central Africa, and indigenous genocide in the Americas significantly\
reshaped social orders and the meaning of the most salient categories of difference. This course examines the\
imposition of these categories from above and how socially marginalized groups pushed back against\
colonial racial, gender, and sexual economies throughout the Atlantic world and in particular societies,\
including Mexico, Virginia, Barbados, Ghana, and the Congo.\

HIST 259 Caravans, Khans, and Commissars: A History of Central Eurasia\
From Silk Roads to Chinggis Khan, an understanding of our world-and an appreciation for the diversity of\
human experience-calls for examining Central Eurasia. This course covers millennia and journeys through\
steppe, desert, and mountain, from Mongolia to Hungary, to reveal the ways Central Eurasia and its peoples\
have shaped world history. Key topics include the emergence of pastoral economies, steppe-sown\
interactions, the exchange of both goods and ideas, and the rise of empire as well as Central Eurasia\'92s modern\
fate. Students consider these issues by examining scholarship and exciting primary sources, including epic\
poetry, art, and novels.\

HIST 270 The Spanish Empire: From Madrid to Manila\
When examining the origins of our globalized modern world, there\'92s no better place to look than the\
Spanish empire during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At its peak it stretched around the world and\
encompassed what is now Spain, Portugal, parts of Italy and the Netherlands, the Philippines and much of\
North and South America. This course considers what it meant to live in different parts of these vast\
territories, including for "old Christian" Spaniards, recent Jewish converts to Christianity, Muslims, Africans\
and their descendants, and indigenous peoples of the Americas and Philippines. It also takes up questions of\
imperial scale, including the challenges of maintaining royal authority over distant lands and how goods,\
people, and knowledge moved throughout the empire.\

HIST 273 US Immigration: Rise of the Immigration Regime\
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free" encapsulates the belief that\
the United States is a nation of immigrants, yet that can be an oversimplification of a deeply complex issue.\
This course explores the various reasons people migrate, acculturate, and what it means to be an "American"\
and an immigrant. Students review immigration records to examine how issues of poverty, sexual\
orientation, gender, race, and political affiliation affected how people "breathe free" and navigated the US\
immigration regime from the late-nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries.\

HIST 276 Saints, Ships, and Sultans: The Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages\
The Horn of Africa represents one of the great crossroads of the world, connecting the Red Sea and\
Mediterranean worlds with those of the Indian Ocean. In the medieval period, the region flourished, with its\
history and society shaped by religion, trade, and politics. Christian states of Ethiopia sought both to pursue\
an independent expression of their faith and link themselves with the wider Christian world. Muslim states\
in Somalia sought political definition and economic power in a booming interconnected global community.\

HILS 279 The Age of Revolution: Latin American Edition\
During the decades surrounding the turn of the nineteenth century, uprisings in the Americas challenged\
colonial authority. This course examines some of those uprisings in the Spanish Americas, including the\
1780s Tupac Amaru Rebellion - the deadliest and perhaps most violent rebellion in the Americas up until\
that time - and the wars that eventually led to independence. We also discuss what it was like to live during\
the time of these tumultuous events. The first Latin American novel, The Mangy Parrot , provides the basis\
for exploring topics that include race, gender, crime, and daily life.\

HIST 280 Health and Healing in Africa\
A perception that Africa is a "diseased continent" has long persisted in the West, but this image, born of\
colonialism, ignores how Africans have sought to create and maintain healthy communities over time. This\
course begins by exploring how Africans have diagnosed and treated ailments in the precolonial era. It then\
examines the impact of colonial conquest and policies on the spread of diseases, and the emergence of\
missionary and colonial medicines. The course concludes by examining how state building, international\
development, and transnational capitalism have shaped healing practices.\

HIST 281 Upstairs, Downstairs, and Outside: Gender, Class, and the Household in British History\
"Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were\
American history." This lecture course interrogates Oscar Handlin\'92s famous maxim by surveying historical\
waves of migration to and immigrant experiences in the United States, focusing in particular on the\
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Immigration from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Latin America is\
situated within the context of an evolving world capitalist economy; expanding and contracting notions of\
citizenship and belonging; national expansion and imperialism; and war. Students participate in communityengaged\
learning by researching histories of immigration to the city area.\

HIST 287 History of East Africa\
Scholars have long subscribed to the myth that East Africa has "historically been detached from the world."\
However, the region's engagements with the rest of the world date back almost a millennium. This course\
seeks to correct the common misconception and introduce students to the rich histories of this lessunderstood\
region of the world. Using a variety of primary and secondary source materials, the course begins\
with an examination of East Africa's roles in world history before European colonization. It then turns to\
case studies and examines the changes that came with colonization, the rise of nationalism and\
decolonization, and finally the post-independence challenges in the region.\

the rise of Putin. It traces the country\'92s myriad transformations from Lenin\'92s New Economic Policy, to\
Stalin\'92s "Revolution from Above," to Gorbachev\'92s Glasnost and Perestroika. Throughout the course, students\

CMHI 291 Land of Dichotomies: North Africa in Late Antiquity\
While treated by some scholars as peripheral, North Africa was and is a central arena in global history. This\
course examines the Maghreb in the dynamic period of transformation that saw the Roman Empire devolve\
into separate political and social entities, ca.200-700 C.E. In these critical centuries, North Africa and North\
Africans served both as anchors preserving Roman culture and society, and key agents in its transformation\
and devolution. Approaching the topic through primary and secondary sources, this course focuses on key\
themes: colonization and resistance, ethnicity and identity, and cultural and social cohesion. Recommended\

HIST 292 The Dawn of the Middle Ages\
The period of Mediterranean history stretching from ca. 300 to ca. 700 C.E. saw both change and continuity,\
radical transformation and sociocultural resiliency. Often maligned as the "Dark Ages," this period has\
attracted a great deal of scholarship, and looms large in the construction of modern national identities. The\
central question is not only how the ancient world became the medieval, and what that meant, but how and\
why this understanding has changed over the years, and why it matters. This course examines the period\
through the analysis of primary sources, key secondary sources, and historiography. Recommended\

This course investigates the twists and turns that attended the transition from imperial regime to modern\
nation in China. Perhaps two of the main legacies of China's last empire, the Qing (1644-1912), have been\
the territorial boundaries claimed by the People\'92s Republic and the tensions that have continued to erupt\
throughout the borderlands: Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Taiwan. This course deepens our understanding\
of modern China by considering why these frontiers are part of the contemporary nation-state and why their\
inclusion continues to be so contentious. Borderlands bring this transition into focus most clearly.\

Public history takes place beyond history classrooms and academic contexts. Traditionally, it has been found\
in museums, walking tours, and performances, and has told the stories of people with social and political\
privilege. Increasingly, however, public history has come to focus on a greater range of voices, and takes place\
in a wider range of forms: on websites, graphic novels, interactive sensory experiences, social media, and\
other digital spaces. In this community-engaged course, students learn to see public history "in the wild,"\
engage with primary sources, and present those sources and historical interpretation to the public in digital\
form. Students with interests in history and public engagement are encouraged to enroll in this course.\

Of the millions of immigrants who arrived in North and South America during the colonial period, the\
majority came not from Europe but from Africa. They came not for freedom but as human property, facing a\

in the U.S. South called it, slavery existed throughout the Americas before its abolition in the nineteenth\
century. By reading contemporary scholarship and examining such primary sources as music, letters,\

Food as one of the most basic human needs has generated incredible efforts to shape the environment.\
Beginning in the nineteenth century, innovations that applied principles of industry to food production have\
resulted in an unprecedented availability of food. But nonhuman organisms have resisted complete\
commodification again and again, and have shaped the U.S. and global food system in return. From the\
vantage point of the United States and the region in particular, this seminar explores how humans linked\
agriculture, labor, science, technology, industry, empire, and global trade and development into a powerful\
industrial-agrarian system that feeds us today.\

debates they have inspired. From disagreements over the identities of mummified corpses in Western China,\
the impact of European explorers collecting cultural artifacts, and the role of Islam among the Mongols to\
Marxist-inspired campaigns to liberate women, the course considers how this region both reflects and shapes\

structures put in place prior to 1948. It then turns attention to the apartheid era and examines the lived\
experiences of the nonwhites under, and their struggle against, the apartheid state. The course pays close\
attention to the experiences of women, union leaders, students, and artists.\

AFHI 301Q Rebellion and The Archive: Studying Enslaved People\'92s Resistance\
Through revolts and rebellions, enslaved people fundamentally challenged the social order of plantation\
societies and attempted to bring alternatives into view. This seminar is organized thematically to approach\
key topics and methodological challenges, including the African context of enslaved people\'92s politics, the\
role of rumor and communication networks, and the gendered politics of revolt. Centered on these issues,\
this seminar engages students in writing histories from below, of trying to understand the lives and\
experiences of enslaved people, their practices, strategies, and political ideas, in a context where many\
surviving records are from the perspective of oppressors. Recommended background: prior coursework in\
Africana or history.\

HIST 301R Freedom of Speech, a Modern History\
Free speech has long been a rallying cry of reformers and a centerpiece of modern, liberal constitutions.\
Despite its centrality, free speech has never been absolute. Dictators fear it, but it troubles more democratic\
societies, too. Words can destroy personal reputation and fan racial or religious hatred. This seminar\
examines the long history of free speech and its limits. Students focus on the United Kingdom and United\
States, drawing connections and comparisons with other European, colonial, and postcolonial accounts. The\
course foregrounds historiographical inquiry, research, writing, and the ever-critical use of history to\
understand the present, and vice versa.\

HIST 301S Environmental History of China\
This course investigates the deep historical roots of China's contemporary environmental dilemmas. From\
the Three Gorges Dam to persistent smog, a full understanding of the environment in China must reckon\
with millennia-old relationships between human and natural systems. In this course students explore the\
advent of grain agriculture, religious understandings of nature, the impact of bureaucratic states, and the\
environmental dimensions of imperial expansion as well as the nature of kinship and demographic change.\
The course concludes by turning to the socialist "conquest" of nature in the 1950s and 1960s and China's\
post-1980s fate.\

HILL 301X All Power to All People: Social Movements of the 1960s\
In 1964, free speech activist Mario Savio exclaimed, "There is a time when the operation of the machine\
becomes so odious\'85 you\'92ve got to put your bodies upon the gears \'85and you\'92ve got to make it stop." In this\
seminar students consider the social movements of the 1960s, a period idealized, criticized, and\
misunderstood in U.S. history. They examine key themes, goals, and tensions within the Chicana/o, Native\
American, Women\'92s, and Black Power movements as groups and individuals used their bodies and voices to\
contest the meaning of American society, and their lasting impacts on US society.\

HIST 322 Mountains and Modernity\
Once regarded as impenetrable barriers dividing Europe, the Alps and Carpathian Mountains were\
transformed into international meeting places with the arrival of mass tourism in the late nineteenth\
century. At the same time, these mountain ranges began to be claimed in the constructions of national and\
ethnic identities that reshaped Central and Eastern Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. The\
course examines the role ascribed to the Alps and Carpathians at a pivotal time in European history, when\
the demise of empires and rising nationalism, but also new ideas about class, gender, ethnicity, and race,\
fundamentally restructured dynamics of power on the continent. Recommended background: a 200-level\

AFHI S13 Black Montreal\
Few people know of Marie-Joseph Angelique, the Portuguese-born black woman who was convicted of\
setting Montreal on fire in 1734, or of Mr. Edward Packwood who created The Free Lance, the first black\
Canadian newspaper. In fact, Afro-descendants have been either miscounted or merely excluded from official\
Canadian records. This course traces the presence of Afro-descended people in the Great White North by\
walking in the footsteps of Afro-descended trappers, settlers, slaves, engag\'e9s, refugees, artisans, cultivators,\
railroad workers, transient workers (such as porters or entertainers), and domestic workers who marked\
Canadian history. It examines the forces that shaped their experience of invisibility and paved the way for\
black internationalism. It also interrogates the tensions within the diaspora concept as it is confronted with\
erasure (diaspora is also constitutive of diasporic identity and community). Students explore these issues by\
examining a range of sources such as novels, oral histories, newspapers, and film. This course includes a short\
ethnographic and cultural expedition to Montreal.\

diverse ways of producing, preparing, and consuming "Chinese" foods. They focus especially on unique\
historical contexts and global patterns of migration, reflecting on what food and food culture might reveal\
about issues of authenticity, identity, gender, race, class, and memory. They consider these topics not only\
through textual and visual sources, but through oral interviews, hands-on cooking demonstrations, and taste\
tests.\

and the place of Latina women in the mid-twentieth century, focusing on the 1938 Pecan Shellers Strike in\
San Antonio, Texas, led by an 18-year-old strike leader Emma Tenayuca, and Luisa Moreno, a Guatemalan\
immigrant who organized workers in Florida and California. Grounded in feminist theory, the course places\

AFHI S22 Marronage: Escaping Slavery, Forging Freedom\
In slaveholding societies throughout the Americas, enslaved people escaped bondage and formed fugitive\
communities in swamps, mountains, and at the fringes of plantations. Some societies were modest in\
population and duration; others included thousands and have lasted to the present. Known as marronage,\
this practice represented a challenge to the ruling order and a reminder of possibility to enslaved people\
nearby. This course uses case studies of maroons in Panama, Jamaica, and Brazil to explore this practice of\
resistance, its practitioners' visions of freedom and its contemporary use as metaphor.\

HIST S24 Race and Citizenship in the Nineteenth-Century United States\
The American Revolution may have created a new nation of citizens out of a piece of the British Empire, but\
the exact contours of American citizenship remained ambiguous and contested. Who decided membership\
in this nation of citizens? Who qualified for citizenship and who did not, and upon what grounds? What\
rights and obligations, if any, were inherent in citizenship? This course examines how various groups of\
people answered these questions \'96 in courtrooms, legislative halls, the popular press, and even the quotidian\
interactions of everyday people \'96 over the course of the nineteenth century. The course pays particular\
attention to how race (as an ideological construct) and racialized peoples affected the development of\
American citizenship.\

HIST S25 From Archives to Studios: Producing a History Podcast\
In 1987, Alice Lakwena, a thirty-one-year-old woman, formed the subversive Holy Spirit Movement. She\
became the only woman to lead a rebellion against the government of Uganda, yet she remains poorly\
understood. Today, she is dismissed as a "witch," "prostitute," and "prophet." Who exactly was Lakwena?\
What motivated her to lead the rebellion? This course introduces students to themes of gender and\
militarism in Africa. Students work with a range of documents about Lakwena and her movement, including\
court records, detective reports, eye-witness testimony, receipts, and newspapers. Students use these records\
to compose scripts and produce a forty-five-minute podcast for the general public.\

students assume the role of historical characters. They debate and decide the most pressing issues of the day,\
while trying to find allies and avoid assassination attempts. Topically, the course begins with the conditions\
and events leading to the overthrow of President Porfirio D\'edaz in 1910, continues through the course of a\
bloody civil war, questions over how to build a new society, and the divisive institutionalization of a\
"revolutionary" one-party state. It concludes with ways that the revolution has been remembered, including\
in art and film.\

they have adapted to, fought with, and lived alongside European invaders and their descendants. Students\
examine some of the ways that European Americans' racism has erased the Native presence in the state and\
its history, the meanings of sovereignty in a state that still retains a great deal of influence over native\

HILL S29 Montezuma's Mexico: Aztecs and their World\
The Aztec state encompassed millions of people, featured a capital whose size and towering pyramids left the\

food and dress to festivals like the Day of the Dead. Yet Aztecs are more commonly remembered for their\
cannibalism than their complex civilization. This course examines the Aztec world: what it was like to live\
under Aztec rule, how society was organized, what people believed about how the cosmos worked, and why\
Aztecs practiced ritual human sacrifice.\

Interdisciplinary Studies\
Students may propose individual majors that cross one or more boundaries of the college's established fields\
of study. A self-designed interdisciplinary major requires a detailed academic program with a list of courses\
to be included in the major drawn from at least two departments or programs, and one senior thesis (INDS\
457, 458), capstone project, or comprehensive examination.\
Further guidelines and an application for the individual interdisciplinary major are available from the\
registrar. Proposals for interdisciplinary majors must be submitted to the registrar for approval by the\
Curriculum Review Committee by 1 March in the sophomore year. Proposals must include a faculty\
advisory board of at least three faculty members who have agreed collectively to act as major advisors. One of\
these faculty members also serves as thesis advisor unless the student's program includes an alternative\
capstone project or comprehensive examination. A student with an individual interdisciplinary major\
graduates with a degree in interdisciplinary studies.\

the politics of ethnicity, religion, age, race, and gender and their influence on daily life; and the forces\
behind contemporary policy and practice in Africa. The course forges students' critical capacity to resist\
simplistic popular understandings of what is taking place on the continent and works to refocus their\
attention on distinctively "African perspectives." Students design a research project to augment their\
knowledge about a specific issue within a particular region. The course is primarily for first- and second-year\

gender disparity in the pursuit of economic development? Do religious traditions offer challenges or\
resources for socioeconomic reform? From Islam among Malay and Hui Chinese communities to Confucianinfluenced\
Christianity among South Korean communities, this course provides an opportunity to explore\
how women\'92s movements in East Asia engage with religious and cultural traditions in their struggles for\
human rights and civil liberties, as well as equal access to education, labor markets, affordable childcare, and\
other development opportunities. Recommended background: one course in anthropology, economics,\

INDS 208 Introduction to Medieval Archaeology\
The Middle Ages were a time of major cultural changes that laid the groundwork for Northwest Europe's\
emergence as a global center of political and economic power in subsequent centuries. However, many\
aspects of life in the period from 1000 to 1500 C.E. were unrecorded in contemporary documents and art,\
and archaeology has become an important tool for recovering that information. This course introduces the\
interdisciplinary methods and the findings of archaeological studies of topics including medieval urban and\
rural lifeways, health, commerce, religion, social hierarchy, warfare, and the effects of global climate change.\

INDS 221 Venice to Tokyo: Religion and Trade along the Spice and Silk Routes\
This course examines the intersection of religion and trade along the silk and spice routes that linked Venice\
and Istanbul with Isfahan, Malacca, Nanjing, and Tokyo in the medieval and early modern periods (800-1800\
C.E.). Adherents of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, and other\
spiritual traditions traversed these trade routes as merchants, diplomats, and pilgrims. As cultural brokers\
connecting Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, these merchants transmitted objects as diverse as silk\
textiles, relics, and texts on philosophy and ethics. This course follows the transfer of culture and commerce\
along these trade routes, focusing on a key thematic question: How are urban economies impacted by\
religion and culture? Cross-listed in Asian studies, classical and medieval studies, and religious studies.\

highlighting power dynamics within the region. It goes beyond the perception of the Caribbean as a space of\
leisure or disasters to show how the U.S. imperial stance has affected the experiences of Caribbean people\
and how Caribbean people have resisted U.S. hegemony. By examining a variety of sources and historical\
scholarship that offer a transnational reading of these historical processes, students analyze how the\
circulation of goods, images, people, and ideas profoundly influenced the political, material, and social\
cultures in both spaces. Special attention is given to issues of race, gender, ethnicity, tourism, and\
immigration. Cross-listed in Africana, American studies, and history.\

People have fled their countries to escape political, ethnic, or religious persecution, wars, dire economic\
conditions, or the consequences of natural disasters. Historical processes such as the global cold war have\
resulted in various population movements. How did gender expectations, relations, and rights impact\
migrants? This seminar examines the role of gender in the migration experience and migration settlement\
practices. By looking at case studies, it explores how migrants have negotiated gendered and racialized\
structures in the United States. Students read a range of texts highlighting several aspects of the migrant\

INDS 301G Black Resistance from the Civil War to Civil Rights\
From antebellum slavery through twentieth-century struggles for civil rights, black Americans have resisted\
political violence, economic marginalization, and second-class citizenship using strategies ranging from\
respectability to radicalism. Engaging with both historical and modern scholarship, literary sources, and\
other primary documents, this course explores the diverse tactics and ideologies of these resistance\
movements. By considering the complexities and contradictions of black resistance in American history and\
conducting source-based research, students develop a deep understanding of the black freedom struggle and\
reflect on the ways that these legacies continue to shape present-day struggles for racial justice. Cross-listed in\

Spain or eighteenth-century New Spain reveal a great deal about early modern (ca. 1500-1800) culture and\
society. Students read and analyze original Inquisition cases from Spain and New Spain as well as consider\
the ways historians have used cases to investigate topics such as sexuality and marriage, witchcraft, and the\
persecution of Jews and Muslims. Cross-listed in history, Latin American and Latinx studies, and religious\

questions of power, silence, and political possibility in and through the archive. The course also emphasizes\
practical challenges of working in the archival research on marginalized sexualities, and will feature hands-on\
research in digital archives and a speaker series by scholars, archivists, and other researchers to share how\
their understanding of sex and sexuality are created and contested by the limits and possibilties of archives.\

Oscar Wilde, an icon today, was popular in his own time as well. His relationship with Alfred Douglas was\
an open secret despite the fact that homosexuality was at the time a criminal offense. Indeed, Wilde\'92s\
sexuality was tolerated until he sued Douglas' irascible father for libel. This course begins with the 1895\
trials, seeking to understand cultures of sexuality in a period notorious for sexual repression, and\
contextualizing issues they raise of scandal and the law, celebrity, gender, and sexuality. Designed to\
encourage independent research, the course guides students through the research process, drawing to the\
fore histories often hidden from view. Cross-listed in European studies, gender and sexuality studies, and\
history.\

INDS S22 Puppets: Theory, Practice, and Play\
This interdisciplinary course examines the questions, concepts, and potential surrounding puppets through a\
combination of hands-on work and play with puppets, discussion, readings, and viewings of puppet\
performances. Readings and other materials offer perspectives on what puppets are, how they interact with\
audiences, and what makes puppet performance a distinct forum for exploring questions about bodies and\
identities. Students test these ideas together using actual puppets to see how theory and practice collide. The\

INDS S23 Creativity and Conscience: Modern Russian Women's Writing and Film\
Women writers, artists and film makers have made significant, often controversial contributions to Russian\
culture for at least two centuries. This course provides an introduction to this diverse body of work by\
focusing on how women\'92s cultural productions have manifested resistance \'96 political, emotional and\
aesthetic. In a political context dominated by patriarchal and masculinist ideals, women have found ways to\
articulate alternative visions, whether responding to oppressive cultural models, political terror or the\
liaisons of church and state. The course begins with the present day and the remarkable efforts of Russian\
women journalists and performers to expose human rights abuse and environmental degradation (Anna\
Politkovskaya, Masha Gessen, Pussy Riot), and then considers work by late Imperial and Soviet writers and\
film makers. Crosslisted in European studies, gender and sexuality studies, and Russian. New course\

INDS S26 Vikings of the North Atlantic: Explorations and Adaptations\
Vikings are often associated with raiding early medieval Europe. They were also the first Europeans to sail\
into the North Atlantic in large numbers. In Scotland they met and mixed with Celtic peoples, but they\
populated uninhabited landscapes in Iceland and Greenland. Around 1000 C.E. their wave of migration\
washed up on the shores of North America where they interacted with Native Americans before abandoning\
the colonization attempt. This course traces this epic movement of peoples, its likely causes, and lasting\
impacts. The island settlements may be seen as cultural experiments leading to adaptation and resilience, and\
sometimes extinction. Cross-listed in anthropology, classical and medieval studies, and history.\

ANLS 205 Citizenship, Borders, and Belonging\
Increasing levels of globalization have prompted scholars to predict the diminishing importance of national\
borders. Contrarily, in the age of detention, deportation, and refugee crises, citizenship has gained renewed\
importance. In this course, students explore different ways of organizing citizenship around the world from\
multiple perspectives including those of refugees, visa seekers, unauthorized immigrants, soldiers, and\
mothers, among others. They examine how formal framings of rights are shaped by a politics of\
representation where the ideal citizen is crafted and contested. They also consider how those excluded from\
legal and cultural citizenship form alternative structures of belonging.\

When examining the origins of our globalized modern world, there\'92s no better place to look than the\
Spanish empire during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At its peak it stretched around the world and\
encompassed what is now Spain, Portugal, parts of Italy and the Netherlands, the Philippines and much of\
North and South America. This course considers what it meant to live in different parts of these vast\
territories, including for "old Christian" Spaniards, recent Jewish converts to Christianity, Muslims, Africans\
and their descendants, and indigenous peoples of the Americas and Philippines. It also takes up questions of\
imperial scale, including the challenges of maintaining royal authority over distant lands and how goods,\
people, and knowledge moved throughout the empire.\

that time - and the wars that eventually led to independence. We also discuss what it was like to live during\
the time of these tumultuous events. The first Latin American novel, The Mangy Parrot , provides the basis\
for exploring topics that include race, gender, crime, and daily life.\

impact on Latin America. Through the examination of specific cases, students explore the various\
manifestations of crime and violence occurring in the region and responses to it by states, citizens, and\
private entities. Some key themes include the significance of weak and corrupt institutions; legacies of\
authoritarianism; police reform; the war on drugs; and the emergence of private security.\

HSLS 325 Weaving Memory and Trauma: Contemporary Spanish American Novel\
The contemporary Spanish American novel that engages historical political violence does so from an\
intimate, textured view of memory and trauma. The memory and experience are entwined within\
recognizable but revised forms of fiction to accommodate voices in tension, while a cohesive plot shapes and\
allows for the questioning of memory placement and the articulation of trauma. Contrary to the \'93gran\
novelas\'94 of the twentieth century, the contemporary novel textures violence by integrating voices that\

HSLL 341 Lectura americana de Cervantes\
A present-day reading in America of Don Quijote de La Mancha and other key texts of the Spanish and\
Spanish American Renaissance. This course examines themes of Islamophobia, white supremacy, conquest\
and empire, the slave trade, the quest for utopias, and the construction of historical narratives that shape the\
politics of the day. Students analyze myths and legends of the marvelous real such as the fountain of youth in\
Florida, the island of California, the return to the Golden Age, fabulous cities and unbelievable real ones\
(Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Cuzco) that are admired and destroyed, and a fake island in Louisiana called Barataria.\
Students consider issues that obsessed people in Cervantes' time: the expulsion of Muslims, hatred of Jews,\
war, gender roles and women's freedom, mental and physical disability, and changes to the environment in\
the form of windmills. Taught in Spanish. Prerequisite(s): one 200-level Hispanic studies course above HISP\

LSPT 352 Participatory Democracy in the Americas\
How far can we press the ideal of true democracy? Is the individual right to vote the apex of democratic\
practice, or might we strive for deeper involvement in politics and the public sphere? This course engages\
canonical debates on the boundaries of liberal democratic practices and casts them against innovations in\
democratic governance. Ideas and solutions are assessed on normative and empirical grounds with particular\
attention to the position of marginalized groups. In addition to seminar-style meetings, the course deploys\
experiential learning techniques to connect theory to praxis.\

LALS 353 Political Violence in Latin America\
Why is public life in contemporary Latin America so violent? Political violence is inherent to revolutions,\
civil wars, and authoritarian regimes. In contrast, one of the merits of democracy is that it facilitates the\
peaceful allocation of resources and power. For much of the twentieth century, Latin America struggled with\
insurgencies, civil war, and repressive authoritarian regimes. A wave of democratic transitions in the 1980s\
and 1990s brought renewed hope for peace, justice, and the protection of civil liberties, but political violence\
persists. This course explores the puzzling persistence of violence throughout the region. Recommended\

LALS 390 Afro-Latinoam\'e9rica\
The 500-year presence of Africans and their descendants in the Spanish-speaking world has produced a\
significant body of literature by Blacks and about Blacks. Spanish America was the main destination of the\
African diaspora. Writers of African descent attest to the struggle for freedom and the abolition of slavery as\
well as anti-colonialism. Their literature shows how the participation of Blacks in the wars of Latin American\
independence was a struggle for their emancipation. Afro-Hispanic writers in Spain, the Americas, and Africa\
use their art and ideas to address the postnational migrations of the twenty-first century, a diaspora that has\
not ceased. Recommended background: AFR 100. Only open to juniors and seniors. Prerequisite(s): HISP\

One of the first major labor victories for Mexican Americans came from an unlikely source: young, Latina\
organizers. This course examines these women, their organizing, and the larger contexts of labor movements\
and the place of Latina women in the mid-twentieth century, focusing on the 1938 Pecan Shellers Strike in\
San Antonio, Texas, led by an 18-year-old strike leader Emma Tenayuca, and Luisa Moreno, a Guatemalan\
immigrant who organized workers in Florida and California. Grounded in feminist theory, the course places\

The first major social revolution of the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution continues to shape\
Mexico well into the twenty-first century. This course centers on Reacting to the Past, a game in which\
students assume the role of historical characters. They debate and decide the most pressing issues of the day,\
while trying to find allies and avoid assassination attempts. Topically, the course begins with the conditions\
and events leading to the overthrow of President Porfirio D\'edaz in 1910, continues through the course of a\
bloody civil war, questions over how to build a new society, and the divisive institutionalization of a\
"revolutionary" one-party state. It concludes with ways that the revolution has been remembered, including\
in art and film.\

HILL S29 Montezuma's Mexico: Aztecs and their World\
The Aztec state encompassed millions of people, featured a capital whose size and towering pyramids left the\
first Spanish visitors in awe, and developed a culture that continues to influence contemporary Mexico, from\
food and dress to festivals like the Day of the Dead. Yet Aztecs are more commonly remembered for their\
cannibalism than their complex civilization. This course examines the Aztec world: what it was like to live\
under Aztec rule, how society was organized, what people believed about how the cosmos worked, and why\
Aztecs practiced ritual human sacrifice.\

MATH 105 Calculus I\
While the word calculus originally meant any method of calculating, it has come to refer more specifically to\
the fundamental ideas of differentiation and integration that were first developed in the seventeenth century.\
The subject's early development was intimately connected with understanding rates of change within the\
context of the physical sciences. Since then, it has proven to be widely applicable throughout the natural\
sciences and some social sciences, as well as crucial to the development of most modern technology. This\
course develops the key notions of derivatives and integrals and their interrelationship, as well as\
applications. An emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding and interpretation, as well as on\
computational skills. Students concurrently enroll in a discussion section. Students must read the\
mathematics department calculus questions page before registering. Not open to students who have\
Calculus on their high school transcripts with a grade of B or above, or who have received equivalent course\
credit through AP, IB, or A-Level examination scores. Successful completion of MATH 106 or 206 fulfills all\

factored uniquely into a product of prime integers. What can we say about factorizations into irreducible\
elements in other algebraic structures? Does uniqueness always hold? If not, which tools can we use to\
measure how different the factorizations of an element can be? In this seminar, we explore numerical\

The famous theorems of Gauss, Green, and Stokes in multivariable calculus have many important\
applications in the study of electromagnetic fields, heat diffusion, fluid dynamics, and complex analysis.\
Moreover, they are all generalizations of the (one dimensional) Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. These\
results assert that a certain (k dimensional) integral over a region is the (k-1 dimensional) integral over the\
boundary of the region, culminating in the so-called Generalized Stokes Theorem. This seminar aims to\
explore this general form of the classical Stokes Theorem and related topics, including the concept of\
differential forms. Prerequisite(s): MATH 301 or 309.\

MATH 495H Cryptography\
Public key cryptography is at the center of most secure transactions these days, from using a credit card\
online to sending and signing secure messages. The security of a cryptosystem relies on finding solutions to\
difficult math problems like factorization of large numbers and the discrete logarithm problem. After an\
introduction to the basics, each student studies various methods of encryption like the RSA cryptosystem, the\
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and various methods of breaking these\
encryptions. These topics draw from previous knowledge in abstract algebra, analysis, geometry, and number\
theory. Computer algebra systems also are used to illustrate the applications. Prerequisite(s): MATH 301 or\

MATH 495L The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\
Over the centuries, there have been numerous proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA), which\
asserts that every polynomial of degree n must have at most n distinct roots over the complex numbers. The\
great German mathematician Carl F. Gauss (1777-1855) published no fewer than four different proofs of the\
result. While the name of the theorem foregrounds algebra, none of the known proofs is purely algebraic.\
Over the centuries, techniques from complex analysis, topology, and field extensions have been employed to\
give new proofs of the FTA. In this seminar, students explore some of these proofs where the methods are\
drawn from various subfields in mathematics. Prerequisite(s): MATH 309.\

Western music traditions. Students acquire a rudimentary musical language through basic ear training, inclass\
exercises, and frequent homework assignments. By the end of the course, students have a basic\
knowledge of how to translate music from an aural to a visual medium and vice versa. Students who can read\
music notation should take MUS 231.\

MUS 210 Classical Music in Western Culture\
An introduction to the study of Western classical music. This course is at once a survey of representative\
works, an investigation of the concepts that have shaped the institutions and practices of classical music, and\
an introduction to the kinds of study that support classical music culture. The course considers the nature of\
a musical tradition in which works are defined by their place in a historical sequence and in which\
performance consists of interpreting historic written texts. Students choose a composer and a musical genre\
as subjects of individual projects. Prerequisite(s): any one course in music or permission of the instructor.\

MUS 212 How Music Performs Culture: Introduction to Ethnomusicology\
An introduction to the field of ethnomusicology, the study of "music as culture." Emphasis is on the\
interdisciplinary character of the field, and the diverse analytical approaches to music making undertaken by\
ethnomusicologists over time. The centrality of fieldwork and ethnography to the discipline is also a core\
concept of the course. Through readings, multimedia, and discussion, students examine relationships among\
ethnomusicology, musicology, anthropology, and world music, and consider the implications of\
globalization to the field as a whole. Students explore applied music learning as well as performance as a\
research technique through participation in several hands-on workshops with the Cheltenham Gamelan Ensemble.\

MUS 218 Soundscapes: Recording and Designing Sound\
This course focuses on the creative acts of recording and sound design. Technical topics covered include\
recording (both studio and experimental techniques), microphone placement, editing and mixing in\
REAPER (an open source software), effects and digital processing, and sound design for stereo and\
multitrack speaker arrays. Creative assignments improve listening skills, foreground aural experience,\
increase awareness of sonic environments, and sharpen skills related to the use of sound as a sensory and\
communication medium. Listening and reading assignments support creative and technical concepts\
covered. Students generate three to four new, original sound-based works during the course of the semester,\

MUS 248 Music in Contemporary Popular Culture\
The last thirty years have witnessed a sea change in contemporary society, as dramatic technological and\
economic transformations have altered the way we see the world. This course addresses recent developments\
in popular music, jazz, and "art" music, examining how trends running from minimalism to hip hop and\
MTV comment upon this cultural environment. The course raises many questions: How has information\
technology altered our worldview? How does recent music reflect our ideas about race, class, gender, and\
sexuality? How does it disrupt conventional ideas about the separation between "high" and "low" culture?\

AFMU 249 African American Popular Music\
The history of the twentieth century can be understood in terms of the increasing African-Americanization\
of music in the West. The rapid emergence and dissemination of African American music made possible\
through recording technologies has helped to bring about radical cultural change: it has subverted received\
wisdoms about race, gender, and sexuality, and has fundamentally altered our relationship to time, to our\
bodies, to our most basic cultural priorities. This course explores some crucial moments in the history of this\
African-Americanization of popular music and helps students develop an understanding of the relationship\
between musical sound and cultural practice.\

MUS 251 Music and Cinema\
Cinema has barely more than a hundred years of history, and sound was only introduced on screen in the\
1920s. This course is designed for composers investigating the ways in which sound interacts with moving\
images beyond the preconceived notion of a "soundtrack." Traditional film scoring techniques such as\
underscoring and leitmotif are investigated through compositional and theoretical affinities between\
Hollywood film music and late romantic operas. Alternative approaches are explored through late twentiethcentury\
narrative and experimental cinema. Students compose a score to a short silent film of their choice.\

MUS 252 Musics of Asia and the Pacific\
Designed for students interested in music cultures based outside the West, this course introduces selected\
historical and contemporary musical traditions of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands, with an\
emphasis on the integration of music, dance, theater, and ritual. The mutual constitution of music and social\
worlds is a core premise of the course. Music and/as place, the performance of group and individual\
identities, and issues of cultural representation are unifying themes. Several hands-on sessions, in which\
students learn to play instruments of the Cheltenham Indonesian gamelan, enhance the grasp of formal principles\
common to a variety of Southeast Asian musics. Regional/cultural focus may vary.\

MUS 253 Music and the Embodied Mind\
An exploration of the nature of musical experience in cognitive, neuroscientific, and bodily terms. Does\
music belong to an altered state of consciousness or is it a function of our ordinary state of consciousness and\
bodily? Why does music compel us to move? Are the emotions that we experience through music the same as\
those that spring from our personal experiences? Is music essentially an interior experience, and if so, how\
does it connect us so powerfully to others? What are the relationships between music and language in the\
brain? How can music and speech become one in song? These questions, long fascinating to philosophers, are\
now being considered through the scientific study of the brain and mind. Recommended background:\
previous study of music, neuroscience, or psychology.\

This course considers a crucial period in contemporary popular music history, situating developments in new\
wave, rock, heavy metal, hip hop, R&B, punk, postpunk, ska, techno, house, country, and mainstream pop\
in relation to the broader social and cultural transformations of the period. In the same moment that new\
pop genres, MTV, and changes in the music industry created spaces for new subjectivities at the intersections\
of race, gender, sexuality, and social class, artists and fans sought to navigate a period of dramatic change, in\
contexts ranging from the rise of new modalities of social conservatism to the expansion of global neoliberal\
capitalism. Students engage with pop songs, music videos, artist interviews, and scholarship in popular music\
studies and cultural studies.\

NRSC 208 Neuroscience, Ethics, and Society\
As our ability to measure, predict, and manipulate brain function progresses, so too does our need to grapple\
with the societal consequences of neuroscientific discovery. This course invites critical examination of the\
ethics surrounding real-world neuroscience applications in private and public sectors. With topics that\
include psychopharmacology and cognitive liberty, neuroimaging for lie detection, weaponization of\
neurotechnology, and neuroprivacy in an era of data mining, students engage two overarching questions:\
How does the practice of neuroscience simultaneously mirror and mold social attitudes and policy-making\
agendas? What does it mean to be a responsible consumer and/or producer of neuroscientific knowledge?\

NRSC 209 Neural Codes: The Language of Thought\
Although a central tenet of neuroscience is that information about the world is encoded in the patterns of\
neural firing, it is increasingly acknowledged that our assumptions about these patterns make qualitatively\
different predictions about neural function. This course examines major hypotheses related to information\
coding by individual neurons and populations of neurons. Specific themes include rate coding versus timebased\
codes, sparse versus dense codes, and the relationship between brain responses and the statistics of\
their inputs. Students examine biological data and artificial models to assess how various encoding schemes\
might produce skillful behavioral responses. Prerequisite(s): NS/PY 160.\

DCNS 240 Neural Networks\
Biological intelligence is characterized by selecting, processing, and storing information while flexibly\
adapting to changing conditions. How might biology inspire \'93smart\'94 algorithms? This course explores the\
fundamental principles of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Students begin with modeling learning in a\
single computational unit (McCulloch-Pitts neuron), and then examine how many simple units can\
collectively give rise to complex behaviors. They examine both supervised networks that learn a\
predetermined input-output relationship, and unsupervised networks that learn \'93suspicious coincidences\'94\
from the input data. They implement neural networks with Python (previous experience is helpful but not\
necessary). Prerequisite(s), which may be taken concurrently: NS/PY 160. Recommended background:\
Experience with Python programming (such as from DCS 109) would be helpful, but is not strictly required.\

NSPY 304 Embodied Cognition, Technoculture, and the Future of Identity\
Whereas much of cognitive neuroscience positions the mind as an emergent property of disembodied neural\
processing, newer theories of embodied mind understand cognition as collective work shared by brain, body,\
and environment. Traditional notions of cognition are further destabilized when we account for the\
potential of technology to reshape the distinctions among these domains. With acknowledgment of\
embodiment and embeddedness as fellow operators of mind, neuroscience must consider how the brain\
interacts with and is impacted by social inequality and body politics of gender, sexuality, race, and ability.\
Drawing upon scientific, theoretical, and literary texts, students contemplate current and future possibilities\
for biology and culture to co-construct identity. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: AF/AM 119, ENG 395I,\
INDS 267, NRSC 130, NS/PY 160, or PSYC 215. Only open to juniors and seniors.\

NRSC S21 Writing about the Brain: Neuroscience and Storytelling\
In this course, students "think about our thinking about the brain.\'94 They consider how scientific findings are\
used to create stories about human meaning and purpose, and how science itself is shaped by the impulse to\
find and create meaning. They study four areas of neuroscience that are routinely in popular media: studies\
of "free will," animal intelligence, mental illness and brain injury, and "split brains." Students critique and\
analyze popular neuroscience media, and craft their own popular-science narratives in the form of essays,\
blog posts, podcasts, and interviews. Recommended background: Familiarity with fundamental neuroscience\
concepts (neurons, synapses, the localization of function to particular brain areas) is helpful, but not\

Philosophy\
Professor Cummiskey (chair); Associate Professors Ashwell, Schofield, and Stark; Assistant Professor Dacey; Lecturer\
Cohen\
The philosophy department encourages all Cheltenham students to take a philosophy course and to consider a\
philosophy major, minor, or General Education concentration (four courses in philosophy). Students new to\
philosophy are encouraged to start off with 200-level courses that focus on particular problems of\
philosophical interest. Topics addressed in these courses include the nature of morality, the justification of\
law, the place of mind in a physical world, the nature of perception, the justification of our beliefs, the\
possibility of knowledge, the social construction of race and gender, the understanding of the self, the\
understanding of space and time, the possible existence of god, the nature and possibility of truth, the\
purpose and proper understanding of language, and the nature of emotions as well as the point and value of\
philosophical inquiry itself. Although critical reading, thinking, and writing skills are developed in all\
philosophy classes, PHIL 195 (Introduction to Logic) provides a more focused study of proper reason that is\
beneficial to majors and nonmajors alike.\
More information is available on the Philosophy department website.\
Major Requirements\
Students who major in philosophy are expected to complete eleven courses in the field. Eight of the eleven\
courses must meet the distribution requirements indicated below. Students are urged to take the courses\
listed in Logic and History of Philosophy as soon as possible after they decide to major in philosophy. The\
philosophy faculty has structured these requirements to allow students the flexibility to plan their own\
programs within the constraints of a broad philosophical education. First-year seminars taught by philosophy\
faculty count toward the eleven required courses. In addition, students may, with departmental approval,\
fulfill one of the eleven courses with a course from another related field. Study-abroad courses and transfer\
courses may satisfy major or minor requirements with the approval of the department chair. Students\
arrange their programs in consultation with their departmental advisor. Those considering graduate or\
professional school are encouraged to consult with their advisor in order to design an appropriate course of\
study.\

Course Offerings\
PHIL 150 Philosophies to Live By\
This course is dedicated to the proposition that philosophy can make life better. It can provide wisdom to\
guide choices and clarify values. It can offer new perspectives and new worldviews. And it can provide the\
insight necessary for self-knowledge and growth. In this course, students read works by philosophers, both\
ancient and contemporary, concerned with the question of how to live meaningful lives. The goal is to find\
ways to apply those philosophies anew so that our own lives are enriched.\

medical practice; the rights and responsibilities of health care providers and patients; the ethics of organ\
transplants and the determination of death; the justification for euthanasia; and problems of access,\
allocation, and rationing of health care services. In addition to Western bioethics, this course typically\
includes Confucian, Buddhist, and Islamic approaches to bioethics. Not open to students who have received\

PHIL 233 Making Moral Minds: Nature, Nurture, and the Sources of Morality\
This course examines the origins and mechanisms of moral judgment and decision making. How much is\
our moral cognition shaped by culture as opposed to evolved nature? How much is it shared with nonhuman\
animals? What motivates us and drives our evaluations? What weaknesses, limitations, and biases might we\
face? In addressing these questions, students read from classic philosophical texts, recent philosophical\
publications, research in psychology, and popular science writing. Along the way, they attempt to glean\
practical lessons for how we think about ourselves, our decisions, and our moral community.\

PHIL 235 Philosophy of Mind\
Our minds are simultaneously the most intimately familiar things imaginable and the most mysterious. We\
live every minute in and with our minds, and we only experience the world through them (perhaps, we even\
are our minds), and yet we may not know them as well as we think. Despite recent progress in the sciences of\
the mind, it even remains difficult to place the mind in the physical universe. In light of these puzzles, this\
course asks: How should we relate to our minds and their operations? How do our thoughts and experiences\
connect to the external world? How could a conscious, first-person perspective arise in a physical universe?\

mean to say that something causes something else? What is one saying when one says that something might\
possibly be other than it is? What does it mean to say that something is the same identical thing at one time\
that it is at another?\

preference, and asks how we can determine what is morally right and what is morally wrong. Topics include\
the relationship between morality and religion, the ethics of patriotism and cosmopolitanism, the nature of\
justice, race and justice, Confucian conceptions of self-cultivation, Buddhist virtue ethics, and finding\
meaning in life.\

how that identity is regarded by one\'92s culture. The course focuses on racism, with particular attention to the\
Holocaust in Nazi Germany and slavery in the United States. Students examine ongoing white supremacy in\
the United States and consider racism as a kind of social and moral luck. Topics also may include moral\
responsibility for implicit bias, the nature of evil, and responsibility and reparations for slavery.\

intersects with other identities, the lives of historically marginalized voices, and the concepts employed in\
feminist political movements and similar social movements such as those centered around race, class, sexual\
identity and orientation, and disability. Additional areas of study may include science and society; gender\
and science; sex and sexuality; reproduction; family; gender in popular culture; and the body and appearance.\

PHIL 271 Ancient Philosophy\
What's the best way to live? For pleasure or for virtue? For oneself or for others? By the conventions of one's\
time or by some timeless truths? The fascination the ancient Greeks had with these questions was inextricably\
linked with others: What is the nature of the universe in which we live? What is the status of our knowledge\
of this universe? How can we understand the processes of change we see everywhere, including in ourselves?\
And what is the nature of philosophy itself? The course begins with the person who most famously asked\
these questions, Socrates, and on the writings in which he is most vividly portrayed, the dialogues of his\
student Plato. Students continue to pursue these questions through the writings of Aristotle as well as the\
famous schools of ancient philosophy, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Skeptics. No prior familiarity with\
philosophy is assumed; this is a perfect place to begin one's study of philosophy.\

relation of the individual and society, and the role of reflection in experience are examined in readings drawn\
from among Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Feuerbach, Marx, Mill, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard. Recommended\

PHIL 321J Self-Knowledge\
We seem to know our own minds -- our beliefs, desires, intentions, feelings, and sensations -- in a distinctive\
and particularly secure way. But although introspective self-knowledge is so familiar, it is difficult to account\
for. This course examines a range of philosophical problems associated with self-knowledge: What (if any)\
are the differences between self-knowledge and other knowledge, such as knowledge of other people's\
minds? Can plausible accounts of the process of introspection be reconciled with plausible accounts of the\
objects of self-knowledge (i.e., mental states and their contents)? Do we even have knowledge of our own\
minds? Prerequisite(s): one 200- or 300-level course in philosophy.\

PHIL 321K Philosophy of Animal Minds\
Nonhuman animals seem like us in many ways, and unlike us in many others. Sometimes they are studied as\
models of human minds; other times, they are studied to discover what (if anything) makes human minds\
unique. Beyond these questions, the cognitive abilities of animals like great apes, corvids, and octopuses are\
fascinating in their own right, and the task of understanding other minds presents a deep and complex\
challenge to science. Students discuss these issues from an interdisciplinary perspective including philosophy,\
psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. Prerequisite(s): two courses in philosophy, or one\
course in philosophy and one course in neuroscience or psychology.\

Language helps us communicate and create important connections with others. Yet it can be used to\
disparage, marginalize, or subordinate people. With the help of classic ideas from the philosophy of\
language, students analyze a number of contemporary issues around power and the effects of social\
discourse. Topics may include: free speech; the impact of hate speech, pornography, slurs, and other harmful\
speech; generalizations (so-called generics); propaganda and ideology; the representation of gender, race, and\
other social categories in language; the relationship between our social position and the effect of our speech;\
and resistance to harmful speech. Prerequisite(s): two courses in philosophy.\

PHIL 323C The Metaphysics of Action\
Some of the most exciting work in contemporary metaphysics seeks to better understand the nature of\
action. The work is compelling not only because it is fascinating in its own right, but also because it has deep\
implications for the philosophy of mind, ethics, philosophy of law, and epistemology. This course takes up\
questions such as: When agents act, what is the relationship between their bodily movements and what goes\

ignorance play in knowing and unknowing? What role does epistemic responsibility play in being justified?\
What is epistemic injustice and how can such injustice be addressed? Prerequisite(s): two courses in\

how biological processes, such as the mind, work today? It also raises questions about who we are and where\
we come from: How do we relate to other species? Can we better understand our moral and intellectual\
strengths and weaknesses by looking to evolution? In this course, students approach these questions from an\
interdisciplinary perspective, including philosophy, biology, and the cognitive sciences. Prerequisite(s): one\
of the following: PHIL 211; two courses in philosophy; or one course in philosophy and one course in\
biology.\

PHIL 324E Virtue and Emotions\
Virtue ethics emerged as an important kind of moral theory during the last half of the twentieth century.\
There are many virtue theories, but they share a focus on the morality of character rather than the morality of\
individual actions. Many seek an answer to the question, "How shall I live?" rather than, "What should I do?"\
This course explores both the historical roots of virtue theory found in Aristotle and, according to some\
scholars, Kant. It also examines several contemporary theories of virtue as well as critics of this approach to\
moral theory. Prerequisite(s): two courses in philosophy.\

PHIL 324F I and Thou: Recognition and Second-Personal Morality\
Morality requires that we treat persons not simply as objects to be planned around or manipulated, but as\
beings with a special status that we ought to recognize or acknowledge. It is this status to which we gesture\
when we talk about owing a duty to someone. Philosophers have long sought to understand the relationship\
that holds between persons who recognize one another's status as morally significant beings. Participants in\
this seminar seek to understand this as well. Readings include both historical philosophical texts and\
contemporary works. Prerequisite(s): one course in philosophy.\

PHIL 332 Moral Psychology\
Facts about how people actually do choose and judge actions seem to matter for how we understand\
morality. But any attempts to trace these connections face the famous gap between "is" and "ought," claims\
about how the world is versus how it ought to be. The last two decades have seen an explosion in work at the\
intersection of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience attempting to make these connections explicit. In\
this course, students attempt to bridge the is-ought gap to better understand our selves, our well-being, our\
duties, our valves, and our biases and limitations. Prerequisite(s): two courses in philosophy, or one course in\
philosophy and one course in neuroscience or psychology.\

PHIL 365D Reparations and Responsibility\
Colonialism, the genocide of native and Indigenous peoples, and the enslavement of Africans and African\
Americans, are foundational wrongs in the United States. It is essential to ask whether the United States-as a\
society, as a government, or as individuals-must pay reparations to Black and brown people and to\
Indigenous people for these wrongs. This course examines what it means to make reparations, whether and\
under what circumstances humans in the present can repair wrongs done by others, and done in the past.\
The course considers the difference between paying reparations for past wrongs and ending ongoing\
injustices. Finally, the course asks what the goal of reparations is, whether it is morally required to pay them,\
and morally justified to demand them. Prerequisite(s): two courses in philosophy.\

PHIL S17 The Ethics of Care\
What is it to care? Whose concerns are centered and whose are marginalized or ignored in caring? This course\
may consider the ethics of caring/not caring in health care/midwifery, in movements for birthing justice, in\
the paid workforce, at home, for the unhoused, throughout history (in whose stories are centered in\
discussions of institutionalized slavery or colonization), and at the margins of life. This course focuses on the\

Homelessness raises special questions for social and political philosophy, for to be homeless is not simply to\
lack an important resource, but to live in a particular condition and social status. This course takes up\
questions such as: Is a home necessary for human dignity? Are laws regulating where the homeless can dwell\
unjust? How does homelessness affect a person\'92s ability to be a full member of their community? Is housing a\
human right, and should it be subject to market norms? Philosophical readings are supplemented with firstperson\

PHIL S34 What is Philosophy? Metaphilosophy and Philosophical Methodology\
This seminar explores the nature of philosophy. What is distinctive about philosophy? Philosophy\
departments typically offer a reply to this question. Do these characterizations of the nature of philosophy\
capture the diversity of philosophical methods and questions? This seminar explores this question by\
considering common criticisms of the value of philosophy, non-Western philosophy, ethnophilosophy, and\
empirically informed approaches to the study of philosophy. The seminar is designed for philosophy majors\
and minors to study the diversity and unity of the philosophical enterprise. Prerequisite(s): Four Philosophy\

Physics and Astronomy\
Professors Lin, Lundblad (chair), and Smedley; Associate Professors Diamond-Stanic and Oishi; Visiting Associate\
Professor De Pree; Visiting Assistant Professors Abdussalam, Gillis, and Rolfe (Earth and Climate Sciences and\
Physics)\
Physics, the study of space, time, matter, and energy, is a fundamental component of a liberal arts education.\
Introductory courses in physics and astronomy are designed to give students a broad background in the\
fundamentals of the discipline, an introduction to the logic and philosophy of science, and insight into the\
understanding and applications of contemporary physics and astrophysics. Advanced courses provide greater\
depth and sophistication as the student's background in physics and mathematics develops. Laboratory\
investigation provides a direct understanding of the central role that experimental research plays in the\
advancement of science.\
More information is available on the Physics and Astronomy department website.\
Major Requirements\
The major in physics can be structured to meet the individual needs of students planning graduate study in\
physics or engineering, as well as those considering careers in business, teaching, government, law, or\
medicine. To learn physics effectively, it is important that courses be taken in the recommended order and, if\
at all possible, with the recommended background. Nevertheless, prerequisites and corequisites can be\
waived in appropriate circumstances, especially in cases of incoming students with strong backgrounds.\

Politics\
Professors \'c1sgeirsd\'f3ttir, Engel, and Richter; Associate Professors Aslan (chair), Baughman, and P\'e9rez-Armend\'e1riz;\
Assistant Professor Gilson, Ko, and Lim; Visiting Assistant Professors Ba\uc0\u269 ovsk\'fd, Grahame, and Price\
Politics is the study of the processes that define, produce, and distribute power, authority, and values.\
Political studies inherently subvert the naturalness and inevitability of what is, by looking historically and\
cross-culturally at what has been in other times or places, and what might be. Politics is a heterogeneous\
scholarly field that utilizes a range of research methods and a variety of diverse forms of evidence, both\
qualitative and quantitative. The discipline analyzes political processes at individual, local, national, and\
international levels. Students consider topics such as states, political institutions, social movements, political\
ideologies, identities, cooperation, conflict, war, and diplomacy. Courses engage multiple disciplinary\
approaches and cultural perspectives, stressing the importance of the diversity of political experience,\
including a global range of politics that address the roles of race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender in\
political life.\
More information is available on the Politics department website.\
Major Requirements\
Students majoring in politics must declare a focus area within the major. Focus areas enable students to\
concentrate on a particular area of interest while also ensuring that they can acquire a broad breadth of\
engagement with topics across the discipline.\
Each focus area requires five politics courses, which include:\
a) no more than one 100-level course;\
b) at least one 300-level seminar, and;\
c) senior thesis (456, 457, or 458) on a topic related to the politics major focus area.\
As politics is a heterogeneous scholarly field that utilizes a range of research methods and a variety of diverse\
forms of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, and as students have opportunity to study topics such as\
state, political institutions, social movements, political ideologies, identities, cooperation, conflict, war, and\
diplomacy, the major is designed to ensure that students have exposure to and can explore a variety of\
themes, topics, and methods. Focus areas emphasize approaches ranging from statistical analysis, to\
qualitative case studies or close reading of a variety of texts:\
\'95 Institutional Politics (IP): Courses examine how formal and informal organizations, rules, and\
norms structure behaviors, social interactions, and outcomes of the political process.\
\'95 Identities and Interests (II): Courses examine how power relations and political choices are both\
embedded in and constructed by conceptions of ideologies, interests, and identities.\
\'95 Political Economy (PE): Courses examine how political and market institutions interact to create\
and distribute wealth locally, nationally, and internationally.\
\'95 Philosophical, Literary, and Legal Studies (PLL): Courses examine the normative core and\
fundamental questions of politics with particular attention to power, value and authority.\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
666\
Return to Table of Contents\
\'95 Security, Cooperation, and Conflict (SCC): Courses examine the nature and dynamics of political\
conflict, contention, and resolution, with a particular focus on war, peace, civil strife, international\
cooperation, conflict resolution, protest, and dissent.\
1. Enroll in a Politics Focus Area Above\
2. Additional Courses Outside Focus Area\
Complete three courses in politics not listed among the courses in the student\'92s chosen politics major\
focus area. These courses must be taken from at least two different focus areas.\
3. Further Additional Courses\
Complete two additional courses in any politics major focus area.\
4. Senior Research and Writing\
Complete one of the following:\
a. Senior Thesis Seminar\
Complete the following course:\
\'95 PLTC 456 Senior Thesis Seminar\
b. Senior Thesis Project\
Complete at least one of the following:\
\'95 PLTC 457 Senior Thesis\
\'95 PLTC 458 Senior Thesis\
A thesis project guided through independent study with a faculty member in politics.\
One senior research and writing experience, which can be completed through the senior thesis seminar\
(PLTC 456) or through a thesis project guided through independent study with a faculty member in\
politics (PLTC 457 or PLTC 458).\
Additional Considerations\
100-Level Courses\
Students may count no more than two 100-level courses total toward the major, and only one 100-level\
course can count toward the student's chosen politics major focus area.\
First-year Seminars\
A first-year seminar may count toward the politics major if and only if it is taught by a member of the\
politics faculty. First-year seminars count as 100-level courses.\
300-Level Seminars\
Students must take at least two 300-level seminars, one of which must be in the student's major focus area.\
Declaring a Major in Politics\
To declare a major in politics, the student must complete both the college's process on Garnet Gateway and\
the department's major declaration form, which is available on the politics department website. The student\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
667\
Return to Table of Contents\
must meet first with the department associate chair, who assigns the major advisor, and then with the major\
advisor to discuss the contents of the politics declaration form. A new form must be completed and approved\
by the department associate chair and major advisor if the student's politics major focus area changes.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Courses not taught at Cheltenham may count toward requirements in categories (2) or (3). One approved nonpolitics\
Cheltenham course can only count toward requirements in category (3). Requirements in category (1), the\
student's major focus area, must be completed with Cheltenham politics courses. Subject to the approval of the\
department chair, transfer students may receive credit for up to four courses toward the major taken prior to\
their arrival at Cheltenham, and must take at least seven courses in the major on the Cheltenham campus. The seven\
courses include the 300-level seminar in the focus area and senior thesis (457 or 458). Students may not count\
internships or courses transferred from other colleges or universities toward the major focus area. Subject to\
the approval of the department chair, students may apply no more than two courses taken outside of the\
Cheltenham politics department to the major. This option may include up to two courses not taught at Cheltenham (e.g.,\
study abroad or summer study). To receive approval for these courses, students must provide evidence of\
their content and to the work completed to the politics department chair. Within this category of courses\
taken outside of the Cheltenham politics department, students may receive credit for no more than one Cheltenham course\
that is not within the politics curriculum. The list of approved courses can be found\
atwww.Cheltenham.edu/politics. This list is updated annually.\
Short Term Courses\
Students may count no more than one Short Term course toward the major.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may be elected for one course applied toward the major. This course must be below the 300\
level.\
Other Considerations\
Students may count no more than two 100-level courses total toward the major, and only one 100-level\
course can count toward the student's chosen politics major focus area. A first-year seminar may count\
toward the politics major if and only if it is taught by a member of the politics faculty. First-year seminars\
count as 100-level courses.\

relationship between states and markets has changed over the past fifty years, exploring such questions as:\
What is a state? What is a market? How do markets constrain the state? To what extent can the state rein in\
market forces? How has the relationship between states and markets changed over time? Do states differ in\
their ability to influence markets?\

This course scrutinizes several sites where power is produced-constitutions, international politics, political\
theory, social movements, and globalization- in order to assess the impact of gender on the status, behavior,\
and authority of different political actors. Recognizing how race, class, sexuality, and citizen status matter,\
students consider why women are under-represented in nearly all governments and how differences in\
national and international settings occur. Students examine questions, concepts, and theories that\
acknowledge women's political agency and help assess their influence across a range of political systems.\

system of sovereign states, the global capitalist economy, and the varied meanings assigned to "nation" and\
"gender." To examine how these structures reinforce, intrude upon, and sometimes subvert each other, this\
course focuses on specific case studies such as international efforts to regulate climate change, nuclear\
proliferation, international trade, and intellectual property rights.\

The course examines the relation of Western political thought to current struggles against various forms of\
oppression. When white Western male theorists use the language of truth and justice, law and order, or\
rights and liberty, do they speak for everyone? Or do their writings reinforce asymmetries of economic and\
social power? Students consider various responses to such questions while reading and discussing selections\
from Plato, Locke, Wollstonecraft, and Marx.\

Is America "post-racial"? Recent media focus on police shootings, wealth gaps, and ongoing debates about\
immigration suggest that race and inequality continue to shape life experiences of Americans in the twentyfirst\
century. This course examines current policy issues, asking how public and private discourses and\
institutional practices shape understandings of race and justice. Students consider how perceptions of race,\
ethnicity, and "colorblindness" are embedded in patterns of disparity and investigate alternatives that\
ordinary people and some political elites are posing for more judicious policy to foster equality and racial\
justice. Recommended background: AFR 100; PLTC 115; or one 100-level history course.\

PLTC 205 State-Society Relations in the Modern Middle East\
Like no other political entity in history, the modern state seeks to transform society into an image of its own\
making and to harness its citizens' productive power for its own benefit. States in the Middle East, like those\
all over the world, have attempted this feat with varying degrees of success and failure. This course examines\
state efforts to dominate and shape society in the Middle East and the myriad ways that social groups have\
resisted, assisted, and otherwise modified state rule. Prerequisite(s): any 100-level course in politics.\

PTSO 212 Race and Mass Incarceration in the United States\
This course provides an analysis of the criminal justice system with a particular focus on the centrality of\
crime policy to the making of race in the United States. Specifically, the course examines the war on drugs.\
Students consider how changes to laws and policies transformed the way we punish crime as a country, and\
their disproportionate impact on Black and Brown communities. Students also explore reformist and\
abolitionist social movements and their efforts to redress these disparities in the criminal justice system\
through policy change. Recommended background: PLTC 115.\

PLTC 213 Great Power Politics\
Since the end of the cold war, the United States has been the preeminent power in international politics,\
with unrivaled military strength, the largest economy, and the greatest influence on global culture. Though\
the United States retains its advantage in each of these areas, many believe its relative strength has declined in\
recent years with the increasing economic might of the People's Republic of China and the growing\
assertiveness of the Russian Federation, challenging presumptions of globalization. This course considers\
whether earlier discussions of great power politics remain relevant to international politics today, focusing\
on the foreign policies of the United States, China, the Russian Federation, and the most influential voices of\
the European Union, France and Germany. Prerequisite(s) or corequisite(s): PLTC 171, 122, 225, or 283.\

PLTC 215 Political Participation in the United States\
Citizen participation lies at the heart of democratic decision making, but its importance extends well beyond\
formal tools like voting. This course explores the many ways in which Americans participate in politics and\
voice demands on the government, both formally and informally, from letters to the president to\
demonstrations in the streets. Students also look at who uses these tools, including the ways in which class,\
race, and gender affect political influence. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: PLTC 115, 122, or 125.\

In this course, students learn how political scientists use statistics. They learn basic statistical concepts, make\
controlled comparisons, use statistical tests and measures of association to make inferences, and conduct\
linear regressions. The course develops practical skills, including the ability to use the computing program R,\
create graphs and perform statistical analysis using R. Students also explore the advantages and limitations of\
statistics as a research methodology as well as questions of research ethics. Politics majors may not count the\
course toward their major concentration; however, regardless of their concentration, students may count the\
course as one of the required courses outside of their major concentration. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level\

GSPT 219 Social Movements in Latin America\
Social movements have often played key roles in Latin American politics. In the 1980s, grassroots movements\
against dictatorships raised hopes that poor and marginalized groups might spur processes of\
democratization and development. In the new democratic regimes, however, significant social and economic\
inequalities persist, marking political and social space in acute ways. This course explores the struggle by\
poor and marginalized groups for space, both theoretically and literally, through examination of rural\
landless movements, urban squatter movements, LGBT movements, and women's movements in the region.\

Students examine four interconnected topics -- gender politics, political fugitives, utopias and dystopias, and\
the social construction of race -- to consider the advantages of narrative writing for expressing one's political\
views. Readings span across space and time, from Ursula Le Guin\'92s The Dispossessed, and Sophocles'\
Antigone to The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.\

In this course, students investigate how people think and feel about politics. They consider the role of\
underlying psychological processes in shaping political behavior of both citizens and elites. They dive into\
the psychological roots of political behavior, focusing on the mechanisms of how people structure their\
political beliefs and make political decisions, including topics such as emotion, bias, and persuasion.\
Students also look at political psychology of groups, and examine reasons why people dislike others, the\
psychological origins of political conflicts, and the pathways to compromise and cooperation.\

PLTC 263 Women and the Women\'92s Movement in Africa\
This course introduces students to the role of women in different contexts throughout Africa. The depiction\
of Africa in Western media is often negative, dealing mostly with civil conflicts, epidemics, lack of resources,\
and human rights abuses. While these certainly remain a reality, they provide a limited perspective. This\
course strays away from such preconceptions and examines issues surrounding women in Africa, including\
political participation, conflict, women\'92s rights, and civil society. Students having taken courses in\
international relations, politics, and gender and sexuality studies may have an easier time understanding the\
theoretical framework, but such courses are not required. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level politics course.\

ESPT 272 Oikos: Rethinking Economy and Ecology\
Economy and ecology share the same Greek root: oikos, or "home." Both name relationships that are crucial\
to the sustenance of life, yet these two domains often appear to be locked in mortal combat. Why is the oikos\
of modern life torn asunder? What is this split and how did it arise? Is reconciliation possible? If so, what\
might it entail? This course brings critical tools from political theory and science studies to bear on these\
questions, exploring a variety of attempts to rethink the relation between economy and ecology and to\
reconfigure the very nature of the categories themselves. Recommended background: one course in\
anthropology, economics, environmental studies, politics, or sociology.\

Intrastate conflicts have been the dominant form of political violence since 1945. While their number has\
fallen since the end of the cold war, they have caused more than 15 million deaths since 1945, and in the\
words of a World Bank overview, represent "development in reverse." Beyond their enormous human cost,\
these conflicts impact many elements of politics, such as state building, political institutions, and the\
ordering of political power. This course examines the causes, dynamics, prospects for peace, and lasting\
legacies of political violence in a variety of cases, through a mix of reading, lectures, discussion, writing, and\
presentations. Recommended background: Familiarity with statistics and calculus is helpful, but not\

rulings as well as evaluating the social conceptualization, representation, and grassroots mobilization around\
these rights. Prerequisite(s): PLTC 115 or 191 or any course in gender and sexuality studies. Recommended\

evolution of social scientific thinking about the economy, in the process identifying some of the central\
critiques and defenses of capitalism as a system of social organization. Then they consider political economy\
topically, addressing a series of policy challenges thrown up by capitalism and considering multiple\
perspectives on how those challenges should be diagnosed and addressed.\

confront the central role of transatlantic slavery in the historical construction of the American polity and the\
American economy alike, and the contemporary reverberations thereof. Finally, they examine phenomena\
such as the radical right, the progressive movement, rural underdevelopment, the declining American\
middle class, welfare reform, and competition for global economic dominance.\

An introduction to key historical and contemporary issues in sub-Saharan Africa, including state formation,\
democracy, civil society, and religion. Despite the large number of countries with different histories and\
cultures comprising the region, sub-Saharan Africa is often too simplified as a place of civil wars, ethnic\
violence, corruption, and poverty. The narrow selection of topics covered by the media and our general lack\
of interest therefore neglect the variety of landscapes, political systems, economic growth, and societyreligion\
relationships, among others. Students analyze the debates surrounding the region to better\
understand its complexities, and explore unfolding patterns of change witnessed at the opening of the\
twenty-first century and ways that younger and older Africans shape their own political and economic\
situations. Recommended background: PLTC 122 or 171.\

Then they explore the notion that freedom can be pursued in different ways, including through politics.\
They examine the argument that freedom can only be attained in and through political action. Finally, they\

PLTC 297 The Household and Political Theory\
Western political theories often acknowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, the importance of domestic\
considerations-such as child bearing, sexual relations, and issues of home economics-but rarely appreciate\
their political significance. And sometimes theorists who acknowledge that the personal is political miss the\
significance of the so-called racial classification or class position of the domestic situations they study. This\
course stresses close reading of theories that highlight the politics of domestic life, and considers how various\
Western classics (e.g., Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Hegel) situate domesticity. Recommended background:\

PLTC 303 States of Emergency\
Scholars and political leaders often distinguish between the "normal" flow of politics and the politics of crisis\
and emergency. The latter increasingly dominate contemporary politics: we live in an era of "permanent\
crisis." How are crises governed? How do political and economic actors prepare for, prevent, mitigate, and\
manage emergencies? Who stands to profit, and who loses? Students examine case studies of various types of\
crisis or emergency in order to understand whether and how crises disrupt or reinforce political and\
economic power relations. Students participate in and analyze simulations of natural and/or manmade\
disasters.\

GSPT 304 Intersectional Political Theory: Lesbian, Black, and Indigenous Feminisms\
In the era of the Women\'92s March, #MeToo, and #SayHerName, "intersectionality" has become a watchword\
in feminist and queer politics. But what does it mean to think, act, or organize intersectionally? What\
conflicts and inequalities do intersectional frameworks identify? Can--or should--intersectional approaches\
attempt to solve these challenges once and for all? This course examines how lesbian, black, and indigenous\
feminists have differently encountered these challenges from the 1960s to the present. Prerequisite(s): PLTC\

PLTC 305 Money and Power\
This seminar investigates the political power of money and finance: the relationship between money and the\
state, the emergence of central banks, the creation of international financial institutions, the role of money as\
an instrument in political lobbying, and the deepening significance of money in contemporary political\
discourse. How did money and debt become instruments of power and coercion? To what extent and how\
does money influence politics and vice versa? How are money and financial institutions regulated at the\
national level? How is international finance governed? What are the economic and social impacts of public\
debt? Does finance undermine democracy?\

EUPT 306 Economic Liberalism and Its Critics\
The 2008 financial crisis, extreme wealth inequality, climate change, and Brexit are a few examples of\
developments that disrupted what we thought we knew about political economy. For the first time in\
decades, big political economic ideas are back on the table. This course offers students the opportunity to\
conduct sustained reading of foundational texts in political economy, including works by Adam Smith, Karl\
Marx, Karl Polanyi, and Friedrich Hayek. What have these texts yet to teach us about both historical and\
contemporary political economic dilemmas? Recommended background: prior course work in the\
philosophical, literary, and legal studies or political economy concentrations of the politics major.\

This course explores the relationship between emotions and politics. As a prelude to discussing the\
importance of emotions in politics, students consider how emotions can be conceptualized and categorized.\
They explore the traditional dualism between rationality and emotion: the relationship between emotion\
and reason, the interaction between emotion and cognition, and the relationship between culture and\
emotion. Then they analyze the place of emotions for different political phenomena. They study how\
emotions play a role in political participation and mobilization, legitimization, and coercion, diplomacy,\
war, and conflict. Recommended background: any 100- or 200-level politics course.\

In this course, students consider how new technologies shape the world of politics. Drawing on a broad set\
of examples from both the developed and developing world, as well as democracies and non-democracies,\
they study how new technologies have affected citizen participation, social movement mobilization,\
elections, governance, security, conflict, political development, and social justice. This course provides\
students with an in-depth survey of the key issues and debates surrounding new technologies and politics.\
Students are encouraged to explore topics of interest in further detail. Recommended background: PLTC 218\

PLTC 314 Space is the Place: Speculative Fiction and Black Radical Thought\
In this course, students engage works of science fiction literature, film, and music alongside radical and\
revolutionary Black political thought. By considering how Black social movements in the U.S. have risked\
imagining the seemingly impossible, we challenge the notion that transformative social change must be\
conceived and brought about wholly in \'91pragmatic\'92 terms. Instead we come to grasp how struggles to protect\
and enhance the lives of Black people are necessarily speculative projects.\

PLTC 318 Sports and Politics from Coubertin to Kaepernick\
"It\'92s just a game." Countless sports fans mutter this mantra to calm themselves in the heat of a contested\
sporting event. But it isn\'92t just a game. From the birth of the modern Olympic movement to\
#BlackLivesMatter protests at various sporting venues, even a cursory survey of American - and indeed global\
- history shows the challenge of separating politics and sports. This seminar explores how sports shaped\
domestic and international politics throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Students investigate\
how sports celebrities became intrinsically linked with the civil rights movement in the United States, the\
Middle East conflict, anti-Soviet resistance, and the recent movement against anti-BIPOC police violence. In\
addition to an in-depth survey of the key issues and debates surrounding sports and politics, students are\
encouraged to explore their topics of interest in further detail. Recommended background: any 100-level or\
200-level course in politics or sociology. PLTC 218 (or equivalent in other discipline) will be useful but not\
required to enroll in the course.\

PLTC 319 The U.S. Presidency: Development and Problems\
When the framers created the U.S. presidency, they created an executive office without precedent in the\
modern world. The course studies their objectives and evaluates how the office and power of the presidency\
has changed over time. Students survey the institutional development and current operations of the\
executive branch, examine the politics of presidential leadership, and consider the impact of the former on\
the latter. Attention is given to those areas of cutting-edge research in presidential studies including the\
managerial capacities of the Executive Office of the President, the scope and limits of unilateral action, and\
changing relations with Congress, the bureaucracy, and the public. Prerequisite(s): PLTC 115.\

connections? Why do origin country governments create pathways to facilitate this engagement? What is the\
impact of immigrants' resources\'97their money, knowledge, ideas, organizations, power, and networks\'97on\
economic and political dynamics in their origin countries? Students explore these questions together by\
examining the experiences of various national origin groups from around the world and through a semesterlong\

does the lack of a world government affect relations among states? When do states do what they believe is\
appropriate, and when do they do what they perceive to be expedient? What are the domestic political\
sources of international outcomes? How and why has the world been organized around different global\
economic orders? To what extent, and in what ways, does international law shape state behavior?\

LLPT 323 Crime, Violence, and Security in Latin America\
Despite a region-wide shift to democracy, Latin America possesses higher rates of violence in the 21st century\
than any other region in the world. Why? This course analyzes the root causes of crime and violence and its\
impact on Latin America. Through the examination of specific cases, students explore the various\
manifestations of crime and violence occurring in the region and responses to it by states, citizens, and\
private entities. Some key themes include the significance of weak and corrupt institutions; legacies of\
authoritarianism; police reform; the war on drugs; and the emergence of private security.\

American political development (APD) is a distinct branch of American political science, which is not only\
credited with "bringing history" back into the study of American politics but also is explicitly concerned\
with how politics is constructed historically. The course is centrally concerned with how political\
institutions, ideas, and culture shape the actions of political actors and policy outcomes over time. Students\
assess the growth, development, and change of a range of political institutions and consider how their\
development affects social policies, including but not limited to welfare and racial justice policy.\

examines how the stories that groups tell themselves about themselves help construct, justify, or contest\
relations of power within the group or between themselves and others. It also asks how such memories can\
be used to overcome the traumas and conflicts of the past. Specific cases are drawn from a variety of different\
countries, including the United States. Prerequisite(s): one 100- or 200-level politics course.\

people? Each topic contains more puzzles: Why have democracies developed a particular style of torture?\
Why are civilians targeted in some wars but not others? Finally, how optimistic should we be? Should we\
despair, or are there sound reasons to believe that wartime conduct has improved? Can such behavior be\
prevented, and if so, how? Recommended background: one social science course.\

start and how they can be resolved. Are such conflicts more prevalent now than during the cold war era? If\
so, why? Is cultural difference really the cause of such conflicts, or is difference merely a convenient frame,\
obscuring more fundamental causes? What makes neighbors turn against each other? Can there be lasting\
reconciliation? What role should the international community play in such conflicts? Prerequisite(s): any\

protest actions are justifiable, and under what conditions? How might we understand the relationship\
between effective and legitimate protest? What are the promises and limitations of violence and nonviolence?\
Is exiting politics \'96\'96 leaving a political society or refusing to participate \'96\'96 a meaningful form of resistance?\
This seminar explores these questions by putting texts in modern and contemporary political theory in\
conversation with works by those who engage in forms of protest themselves.\

democratic governance. Ideas and solutions are assessed on normative and empirical grounds with particular\
attention to the position of marginalized groups. In addition to seminar-style meetings, the course deploys\
experiential learning techniques to connect theory to praxis.\

PLTC 353 Political Violence in Latin America\
Why is public life in contemporary Latin America so violent? Political violence is inherent to revolutions,\
civil wars, and authoritarian regimes. In contrast, one of the merits of democracy is that it facilitates the\
peaceful allocation of resources and power. For much of the twentieth century, Latin America struggled with\
insurgencies, civil war, and repressive authoritarian regimes. A wave of democratic transitions in the 1980s\
and 1990s brought renewed hope for peace, justice, and the protection of civil liberties, but political violence\
persists. This course explores the puzzling persistence of violence throughout the region. Recommended\

The depiction of Africa in Western media is often negative, dealing mostly with civil conflicts, epidemics,\
lack of resources, and human rights abuses. While these certainly remain a reality, they provide a limited\
perspective. This course strays away from such preconceptions and examines issues surrounding women and\
gender in Africa, including political participation, conflict, women\'92s rights, and civil society. Students having\
taken courses in international relations, politics, and gender and sexuality studies may have an easier time\

peacekeeping and the reasons for its increased relevance in the post-cold war era. It considers the different\
forms that peacekeeping, peacebuilding, or peacemaking have taken and the various formal and informal\
practices associated with such interventions. Students discuss the definitions of success in evaluating\

warfare. Students examine the conventions of war in different societies and consider the origins and\
dynamics of the laws of war, why states often violate these rules and the conditions under which they\
comply, and the political and ethical dilemmas in enforcing them. Topics include weapons bans, protection\
of prisoners and civilians, targeted killings, torture, and occupation, and war crimes tribunals.\

capitalism and democracy. Do contemporary formulations of this diverse and venerable tradition show how\
to negotiate the contested terrain of twenty-first-century cultural politics? Or is Western liberalism necessarily\
an apologist for the exclusionary politics of a bygone era? Students read and criticize recent authors who\
discuss these questions against the backdrop of canonical texts. Prerequisite(s): two courses in politics.\

PLTC S26 The Forever Wars: The Politics of U.S. Involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq\
2021 marks two decades since the September 11th attacks, the starting point of U.S. military intervention in\
Afghanistan and Iraq. Thus, these conflicts have been underway since before the birth of most Cheltenham students,\
and have deeply affected the world we live in. This course summarizes the history of these conflicts,\
introduces theories on conflict, and examines the decision making of key actors, to address four questions:\
How did the United States become involved in these prolonged conflicts? Why did the United States fail to\
achieve its goals? Could these results have been predicted? What lessons might be learned?\

PLTC S33 Central European Theater and Politics\
A study of Hungarian and Czech history, politics, and theater since about 1945. Our focus is on the impact\
on theater of the cataclysmic social and political changes in Central Europe since the Hungarian uprisings of\
1956. Other seminal events bearing on this study are the Prague Spring of 1968, the collapse of the Soviet\
bloc in 1989, and the subsequent rebuilding of politics and culture in the region up until today. In\
conjunction with our study of history, politics, and drama, students read an array of secondary sources on the\
social and cultural history of post-war Central Europe. Classes will be conducted as discussions, led by the\
Cheltenham instructors and Hungarian, Czech, and other Central European artists and scholars. Students maintain\
a journal describing and analyzing the plays, readings and other academic materials studied. Recommended\
background: one course in European studies, theater, or politics.\

Psychology\
Professors Aronson, Boucher, Douglass, Kahan, and Low; Associate Professor Sargent (chair); Assistant Professors\
Garrison and Maker-Castro; Visiting Assistant Professors Langdon, Mathis, and St. Pierre; Visiting Lecturer Douglass\
Students who major in psychology examine behavior and mental processes using scientific methods; they\
learn to apply this knowledge in real-world and laboratory settings. Students examine a variety of topics and\
methods within psychology across a wide range of subject areas (breadth) and study selected topics in greater\
detail (depth). To accomplish breadth, students take three intermediate courses. These courses are designed\
to provide students with a broad overview of a variety of intellectual approaches within psychology. To\
accomplish depth students take three upper-level courses, each of which is designed to provide a deeper\
exploration of a psychological topic. The goal of depth is also accomplished through the senior thesis. Majors\
must complete a thesis in one of four ways: empirical research, community-based research, theoretical review\
and integration, or neuroscience-focused capstone.\
Because the study of psychology is incomplete without an understanding of how the brain, nervous,\
cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems affect behavior and mental processes, students must take one\
course with a central focus on the brain and some combination of these other biological systems. These\
courses are marked with the attribute (Biological.) The study of psychology is also incomplete if students do\
not engage with issues pertaining to inclusion (how to ensure people from different backgrounds feel\
included in a given context), diversity (how to ensure broad representation of various backgrounds), equity\
(how to ensure people are treated equitably), and accessibility (how to ensure people have the support they\
need to do their best work). Although engagement with such issues is infused throughout the curriculum in\
many courses, and these principles guide the faculty's decision making in general, students must also take\
one course with a central focus on some combination of issues related to inclusion, diversity, equity, and\
accessibility. (These courses are marked with the attribute (IDEA.).\
More information is available on the Psychology department website.\

Senior Project Description\
A thesis may be completed during the fall and/or winter semester of the senior year. Topics for thesis must be\
approved by the department.\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\

Return to Table of Contents\
For fall semester and two-semester thesis:\
1) students register for one of the following thesis options: PSYC 457A (empirical research), PSYC 457B\
(community-based research), PSYC 457C (theoretical review and integration), or PSYC 457D (empirical\
research thesis seminar)\
2) proposals must be submitted by 4:00 p.m. on Thursday of the second full week of classes in the fall\
semester.\
In the fall semester, students in PSYC 457B and PSYC 457D meet in a seminar and the instructor serves as\
advisor.\
For winter semester theses:\
1) students register for one of the following thesis options: PSYC 458A (empirical research), PSYC 458B\
(community-based research), PSYC 458C (theoretical review and integration), or PSYC 458D (empirical\
research thesis seminar)\
2) proposals must be submitted by 4:00 p.m. on the second Thursday in November.\
In the winter semester, students in PSYC 458B and PSYC 458D meet in a seminar and the instructor serves as\
advisor.\
Guidelines for proposals (and a listing of important dates) are on the department's website\
(Cheltenham.edu/psychology/thesis/thesis-planning/senior-thesis-proposal-guidelines/).\
All seniors must present their thesis work at a general meeting of the department at the end of the semester.\
Presentations take the form of a ten- to fifteen-minute talk or a poster that describes the project.\
Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
Psychology majors may transfer up to two credits taken elsewhere toward the major, provided the courses are\
preapproved by the department chair. Students should submit to the chair a course description and syllabus\
for each transfer course. A student may not get credit for a course at Cheltenham if they have credit for a course with\
substantially the same content taken elsewhere, even if the courses could fulfill different major requirements.\
For example, a student could not get credit for PSYC 303 (Health Psychology) at Cheltenham if they had already\
received credit for a health psychology course taken elsewhere, even if that course transferred as a foundation\
course. A student may transfer credit for Principles of Psychology (PSYC 101) taken elsewhere as long as the\
course is taken before the student declares psychology as a major at Cheltenham. Students may earn credit for PSYC\
101 by 1) earning a four or five on the Advanced Placement examination or 2) earning a transferable grade\
for the equivalent course at another institution of higher education. There is no option to test out of PSYC\
101 and receive credit for the course. Earning credit for PSYC 101 enables students to take courses for which\
PSYC 101 is a prerequisite. Earning credit for PSYC 101 reduces by one the number of courses required to\
fulfill the major. With the chair's approval, one of the two courses may be a statistics or methodology course\
that may be used in lieu of Statistics (PSYC 218), Research Methods (PSYC 261), or Community-Based\
Research Methods (PSYC 262), but students are strongly encouraged to take their statistics and methodology\
courses at Cheltenham. Students considering off-campus study should keep in mind several considerations. Either\
PSYC 261 or PSYC 262 must be completed before the end of the junior year, and PSYC 218 (Statistics) is a\
prerequisite for either course. Moreover, the department not only encourages students to take their statistics\
and methods courses at Cheltenham, but also cautions students that it is extremely rare to find a non-Cheltenham statistics\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
703\
Return to Table of Contents\
or methods course that is sufficiently comparable to qualify for major credit. These considerations have\
significant implications for students who do not complete Statistics by the end of their sophomore year.\
Students considering a major in psychology should be aware that if they are unable to complete Statistics by\
the end of the sophomore year\'97even if that inability is a product of being randomized out of the course\
during preregistration\'97then they will likely have to stay at Cheltenham both semesters of the junior year in order\
to keep psychology viable as a major option. If courses are transferred from somewhere else, then the total\
number of course credits required to complete the major decreases accordingly. Transfer Students Subject to\
the approval of the department chair, transfer students may receive credit for up to five courses toward the\
major taken prior to their arrival at Cheltenham, and must take at least six courses that are listed in psychology or\
cross-listed with psychology on the Cheltenham campus. The six courses must include one upper-level course and\
the capstone course.\
Short Term Courses\
Short Term courses may not be counted toward the major for Class of 2024 and beyond.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for courses applied toward the major.\
Other Considerations\
At the end of each academic year, the department invites a limited number of juniors to submit honors thesis\
proposals, due in the fall semester of their senior year. Honors invitations are based on demonstrated\
excellence in the courses completed for the major through the end of the junior year. If invited for honors,\
students must elect a two-semester thesis. At the end of the first semester of thesis work, the department\
formally nominates students to the honors program. Students who are nominated must show a high degree\
of initiative and progress by the end of the fall semester. In addition, the faculty thesis advisor must assure\
the department that the student's work is of honors caliber and is progressing satisfactorily before the\
department nominates the student to the honors program. Embracing the notion of intellectual breadth in a\
liberal arts context, the department strongly encourages psychology majors to select General Education\
concentrations (GECs) with little to no overlap with their psychology course work. Academic advisors work\
with students to ensure that their choice of GECs serve as areas of critical inquiry outside of the psychology\
major. Students cannot double major in psychology and neuroscience.\

An exploration of the nature of musical experience in cognitive, neuroscientific, and bodily terms. Does\
music belong to an altered state of consciousness or is it a function of our ordinary state of consciousness and\
bodily? Why does music compel us to move? Are the emotions that we experience through music the same as\
those that spring from our personal experiences? Is music essentially an interior experience, and if so, how\
does it connect us so powerfully to others? What are the relationships between music and language in the\
brain? How can music and speech become one in song? These questions, long fascinating to philosophers, are\
now being considered through the scientific study of the brain and mind. Recommended background:\

NSPY 304 Embodied Cognition, Technoculture, and the Future of Identity\
Whereas much of cognitive neuroscience positions the mind as an emergent property of disembodied neural\
processing, newer theories of embodied mind understand cognition as collective work shared by brain, body,\
and environment. Traditional notions of cognition are further destabilized when we account for the\
potential of technology to reshape the distinctions among these domains. With acknowledgment of\
embodiment and embeddedness as fellow operators of mind, neuroscience must consider how the brain\
interacts with and is impacted by social inequality and body politics of gender, sexuality, race, and ability.\
Drawing upon scientific, theoretical, and literary texts, students contemplate current and future possibilities\
for biology and culture to co-construct identity. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: AF/AM 119, ENG 395I,\

Religious Studies\
Professors Baker (chair) and Bruce; Associate Professor Melnick Dyer; Visiting Assistant Professor Goodwin\
Religious Studies is a humanistic and social-scientific discipline that provides windows onto a wide range of\
cultural phenomena and contemporary social questions. It explores religion as a foundational element in all\
cultures while drawing together \'96 and providing opportunities to sharpen one\'92s skills in \'96 multiple methods\
of study, including those associated with history, literature, ethnography, political science, anthropology,\
sociology, critical race theory, philosophy, psychology, natural sciences, critical gender theory, cultural\
studies, and theology. Majors and minors are encouraged to explore how their studies in other fields intersect\
with religious studies questions, concerns, and methods.\
Religious studies majors work closely with members of the department in designing their program of study\
and their thesis project. Although the Senior Research Seminar and Thesis are the only courses required of\
every major, all majors a) take courses at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels; b) gain breadth\
and depth in their understanding of a variety of religious traditions and practices; and c) develop skills in a\
wide array of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of religion. The department strongly\
encourages study abroad, and students may petition to count up to two credits earned abroad toward the\
major or minor.\
More information is available on the Religious Studies department website.\
Major Requirements\

requirement provide an introduction to the study of religion within a particular disciplinary context\
(e.g., Greco-Roman religions, philosophy of religion, psychology of religion, sociology of religion,\
anthropological approaches to the study of religion, religion and civil rights), or provide comparative\
studies of multiple religious traditions and/or multiple approaches to the study of a single tradition.\

One course from each of four areas of study (for a total of four courses; courses that are listed in more\
than one area cannot be counted twice). By taking courses in a variety of religious traditions, time\
periods, and geographic locations, students begin to develop cultural literacy across a wide range of\
world religions, even as they hone their understanding of the methodologies and theories common to\
religious studies. Each faculty member highlights different methods and theories in the courses they\
offer; by studying with different faculty in the department, students develop breadth in their working\
knowledge of the field, as a whole, and intersectional understandings that complicate conventional\
definitions of "religion" and "religious" identities.\

REL 100 Religion and Film\
This course introduces students to cinematic representations of religion in feature and documentary films.\
Films about religion are cultural documents in and through which individual artists, religious and\
nonreligious groups, and nations symbolically construct their conceptions of themselves and the world. They\
are also the occasion for political, social, and cultural debates about ethnic and national identities. This\
course adopts a cultural studies approach to the study of films about religion and invites students to\
investigate the public debate and interdisciplinary questions and issues raised by the release of films such as\
Avatar, Schindler\'92s List, The Passion of the Christ, Daughters of the Dust, and The Hurt Locker.\

AFRE 107 Religion, Race, and Resistance: From Black Secularism to Black Power\
This course explores religion's complex and contested influence on over four centuries of changing Black\
freedom struggles in the U.S. context. In particular, this course argues that freethought -- a term that\
encompasses atheism, agnosticism, nonbelief, and religious skepticism, among other epistmologies and\
ontological frameworks -- has provided a powerful yet underconsidered intellectual and philosophical basis\
for historical and contemporary organized Black resistance to white supremacy.\

Canada. The course explores the foundational teachings of each tradition, examines their historical and social\
contexts, and seeks answers to questions such as: What is the nature of religious experience? What are the\
functions of myth and ritual? How have these religious traditions been adapted, adopted, and appropriated\
in "the West"?\

gender relations links to the ways in which other social institutions are articulated and justified. Topics\
include the creation of the cosmos, characterizations of the Creator, the origins and perfection of humanity,\

both in the development and sanctioning of national mythologies, and in the critique or criticism of these\
mythologies. The historical background of such considerations begins with Native American religions. The\
course concludes with a study of "religious freedom" in a multicultural nation again uncertain of its grounds\

This course explores daily life and community in the Middle Ages through festivals, holidays, and marking\

and how individuals and groups responded to environmental factors. Second, they consider the role of such\
seasonal rituals as a means of creating social cohesion and coercion. Medieval festivals and holidays were not\
just fun: they frequently sought to impose specific visions of social and religious order on participants (and\
those who were excluded). Third, students reflect on how holidays and communal rituals still have power to\
shape community, identity, and belonging in contemporary society. The course helps students learn about\
medieval religious and cultural practices in a critical manner; while focusing on Christian traditions, they\
also consider Jewish and Muslim customs in a broader European context. Recommended background: prior\

traditions from the colonial era to the present. Throughout American history, African Americans have used\
religion not only as a means of expressing complex views of themselves and their world, but also as a form of\
cultural critique, social reform, economic independence, and political activism. Among the movements and\
topics discussed are African and Caribbean religious influences, slave religion, the rise of African American\
denominations, the Nation of Islam, the importance of spirituals and gospel music, Afrocentricity, and the\
civil rights movement. Given the complex nature of African American religious experience, this course\
adopts an interdisciplinary approach and draws upon scholarship on religion in sociology, politics, history,\
art, literature, and music. Prerequisite: any 100-level religious studies course.\

For many, "medieval" is simply another word for "superstition"\'94 and the Middle Ages were consumed by\
delusion punctuated with witch trials. This course instead focuses on religious and folk practices beyond\
orthodox Christianity in the Middle Ages, to understand the realities of "magical" practice and supernatural\
beliefs during the period and move away from misconceptions based on Enlightenment polemic and\
modern fantasy. Students discover the variety of beliefs associated with the concepts of magic and\
supernatural and come to understand that these concepts were not always seen as evil, or even wrong, by\
contemporaries. Students consider the differences between how learned and unlearned magic were perceived\
and the gender dynamics at the heart of this dichotomy. They explore the syncretic relationship between\
medieval Christianity and paganism and other traditional beliefs, as well as the overlap between "magic" and\
primitive science. Recommended background: prior coursework on the pre-modern world.\

Hero or traitor? Freedom fighter or terrorist? Few historical figures are more polarizing than John Brown\

Virginia (now West Virginia). This course contextualizes Brown's life, legacy, and abolitionist principles in\
its proper nineteenth-century cultural, religious, theological, and political milieu. As an evangelical Calvinist\
Christian, Brown's faith guided his values and gave him strength in the abolitionist cause, and his piety\
fertilized his deeply held call to destroy the institution of slavery.\

ASRE S28 From Shangri-la to Radical Dharma: Buddhism in North America\
How did Buddhism first come to North America? How has it changed since its arrival? This course examines\
the development of Buddhism in the Americas since the nineteenth century. Students discuss different paths\
of Buddhist traditions from Asia to North America, and the ways that newly arrived Buddhists, and adopters\
of the tradition, have changed the face of what it means to be "Buddhist" in the "West." They consider\
shifting self-identification with the tradition, both among convert groups and in historically Buddhist\
communities, and the role of race and gender in the religion's development in the twenty-first century. The\
course includes brief trips to Dharma centers in the region as well as a "digital religion" component and\
several film screenings. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: REL 110, GS/RE 311, AS/RE 208, 248, 249, 250,\

REL S51A Creating Religious Studies: A STIP Course\
This short-term course is devoted to designing a new introductory-level Religious Studies course to be\
required of all majors and minors. The course introduces students to the ways in which the field of Religious\
Studies has been constructed alongside, and as an integral part of, modern systems of colonialism, racism,\
and Western white supremacy and how the field also continues to be transformed by the work of\
minoritized scholars/communities and cross-cultural collaborations.\

Rhetoric, Film, and Screen Studies\
Professors Kelley-Romano and Nero; Associate Professor Cavallero (chair); Visiting Assistant Professor Otis; Lecturer\
Hovden\
Rhetoric, film, and screen studies offer an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human communication\
that focuses on the intersectional nature of meaning and knowledge.\
Rhetoric is a vital aspect of modern democracy. Courses offered by the Department of Rhetoric, Film, and\
Screen Studies teach students to understand how citizens use the symbolic in processes of negotiation within\
democratic states. Historically, this understanding has come through study of oratory, writing, and debate.\
But as the public sphere has expanded, so have the skills needed for successful agency: skills also now address\
visual media such as film, television, and virtual worlds.\
Courses examine the production of meaning in texts and screen texts through the study of the systems that\
create texts; the form of those texts; and the historical, sociocultural, and economic milieus that mediate their\
circulation and interpretation. Courses are informed by theories that examine race, ethnicity, gender,\
sexuality, and class, among other categories. In addition to introductory courses, students are required to take\
courses in performance. Students take two seminar courses with two different professors to further expand\
their exploration into the breadth of rhetoric, film, and screen studies. All students complete a senior thesis.\
Argumentation and debate are traditional aspects of the practice and study of rhetoric, and have long been\
considered essential elements to a functioning public sphere. Cheltenham has a storied tradition of excellence in\
debate, and students may study argumentation in courses or participate in competitive debate, or both. The\
Brooks Quimby Debate Council (BQDC), teaches students basic elements of rhetorical practice and theory.\
More information is available on the Rhetoric, Film, and Screen Studies department website.\

RFSS 100 What is Rhetoric?\
Although the oldest discipline, rhetoric may be the least understood. Aristotle defined rhetoric as "the faculty\
of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion." In this course, students conduct a historical\
survey of rhetorical theory from classical times to the present to critique the role of language in establishing,\
perpetuating, and challenging power. Rhetorical artifacts examined include political speeches, television\
programs, print advertisements, editorials, music, film, and social media.\

This course is designed to introduce students to the production techniques, historical context, cultural\
function, and critical analysis of various film and television texts. Both film and television play an important\
role in defining, challenging, and reinforcing cultural norms and practices. By looking critically at a number\
of texts and artifacts, the course encourages students to develop a better understanding of the role film and\
television play in defining cultures and "reality."\

Since its origins in the early twentieth century, film has debated how to represent black suffering. This course\
examines one aspect of that debate: the persistent themes of white goodness, innocence, and blamelessness in\
films that are allegedly about black history and culture. Historical and cultural topics examined in film\
include the enslavement of Africans, Reconstruction, and the civil rights movement.\

RFSS 202 Coming of Age While Black\
This course proceeds from the premise that coming of age while Black is fraught with the dangers created by\
a system of anti-black surveillance. Students examine "coming-of-age" memoirs and films that began during\
the era of the U.S. civil rights movement in the 1950s. Typically, the films and memoirs in this sub-genre\
feature a young Black protagonist, often a teen, navigating, sometimes successfully but not always, a world\
defined by intersecting oppressions created by race, class, gender, sexuality, and/or colonial identity.\

This course investigates a number of films, filmmakers, film industries, and film movements that have\
changed the shape of movies and expanded our understanding of what is possible with cinema. Students gain\
a greater knowledge of the global cinematic landscape and discern the role that cinema plays in global and\
local cultures. The course is particularly sensitive to the representation of race and gender and asks how a\
sensitivity to local cultural traditions might challenge or change readings of specific texts. Films from Iran,\
Brazil, Senegal, France, Australia, Italy, Japan, India, China, and Germany may be considered.\

RFSS 220 Constructions of Italian American Men and Masculinities\
From Rudolf Valentino to The Godfather to Jersey Shore, American media makers and audiences seem\
obsessed with the Italian American man. In challenging cultural conventions and brazenly refusing to\
conform to accepted social norms, the Italian American male in popular culture is simultaneously admired\
and feared. Representations of the Italian American male indulge fantasies of total freedom while providing\
a cautionary tale that endorses social conformity. This course examines representations of Italian American\
men to determine the cultural place of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class, with attention paid to the\
rhetorical usage of these overlapping identities. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: RFSS 100, RFSS 120, or\
AF/RF 162.\

What is a film? How should films be viewed? What cultural role do the movies play? As might be expected,\
such open-ended questions have yielded no shortage of answers. This intermediate-level film studies course\
introduces students to some of the dominant theoretical models that have surfaced throughout the history of\
film theory (including formal film analysis, realism, Soviet montage theory, documentary theory, and\
experimental film theory), while also exploring issues of cultural studies, authorship, ideology,\
representation, digital cinema, reception studies, and global and transnational cinema. In coming to an\
understanding of these approaches, students develop a deeper comprehension of the cultural place and\
artistic significance of the movies. Prerequisite(s): RFSS 100, 120, or AF/RF 162.\

narratives light-skinned people move across racial lines supposedly fixed by biology, custom, and law. In\
trespassing narratives black persons enter spaces denoted as white by law or custom. This course calls\
attention to fear, fantasy, punishment, and resistance as ongoing dimensions of race and white supremacy.\

RFSS 265 The Rhetoric of Women's Rights\
Throughout American history the roles and rights ascribed to women have differed from those ascribed to\
men. Because of their differing situations, women have had to use rhetorical means to attain their goals of\
equality and access to the public sphere. This course examines rhetorical strategies used by women to\
overcome the exigencies they faced. It considers the rhetoric of oppositional voices who have challenged the\
goals of the feminist movements and the rhetoric in the broader social environment that establishes the\
social norms and values in which the movement must operate. Students learn and apply the tools of\
rhetorical criticism in order to identify, describe, and evaluate the rhetorical strategies. Prerequisite(s): one of\
the following: RFSS 100, RFSS 120, or AF/RF 162.\

RFSS 271 Film Noir, Its Influences, and Its Legacies\
From private eyes, femme fatales, and criminal masterminds to byzantine plots, double crosses, and good\
old-fashioned nihilism, film noir has contributed much to cinematic history and contemporary film. This\
course considers its influences, such as pulp magazines' hardboiled fiction and German expressionism, and\
examines its legacies into the twenty-first century. Students question what film noir actually is: A genre? An\
ethos? A lighting scheme? The course also interrogates film noir's rhetorical constructions of gender, race,\
class, and sexuality from its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s into the present. Finally, the course considers why\
these films continue to be so influential. Prerequisite(s): AF/RF 162, RFSS 100, or RFSS 120.\

This course investigates intersectionality as an orientation toward critical practice for both scholars and\
activists. Students consider intersectionality as a theory, exploring its utility for understanding and explaining\
lived experiences of marginality and privilege. They explore intersectionality as a method for engaging in\
activism/advocacy as well as for analyzing and evaluating rhetorical texts. They also interrogate\
intersectionality as an issue of discipline, exploring the concept\'92s disciplinary roots in Black feminist theory\
and politics while also considering how the study of intersectionality has created an exigency in the\
discipline of rhetoric to amplify certain voices and issues. Prerequisite(s): AF/GS 201; AF/RF 162; GSS100; or\

surrounding topics such as the rhetorical construction of the athlete, sporting events, athletes as racialized\
and gendered bodies, the commodification of the athlete, athletes and activism, and fandom and\
identification. Prerequisite(s): RFSS 100, 120, or AF/RF 162.\

Students examine how representations of race, class, sexuality, ability, and other categories of analysis are\
articulated in science fiction and fantasy on television. Prerequisite (s): RFSS 100, 120, or AF/RF 162..\

RFSS 391F Bollywood\
This course develops a historical understanding of Bollywood while demonstrating that the economic\
realities of a globalized world have ethical implications for cultural production. The course considers the\
history of Bollywood productions from the 1950s to the 1990s, a time in which the aesthetic style and\
production practices of these films were established; special attention is paid to the gender, racial, sexual, and\
class politics of these movies. Next, students consider the industry's global popularity and the lucrative\
potential of transnational audiences. Finally, they investigate how Hollywood and independent films have\
attempted to capture a more traditional Bollywood audience. Films under study include Mother India,\
Zanjeer, Dhoom 2, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and Slumdog Millionaire. This seminar is recommended\
for sophomores and juniors. Prerequisite(s): one course in rhetoric, film and screen studies.\

RFSS 391M Rhetorics of the Body: Intersections of Identity, Power, and Culture\
Bodies are profoundly rhetorical: they compel audiences to act, think, and be in the world differently.\
Rhetoric is also profoundly embodied: rhetorical messages are articulated through bodies that exist at the\
intersection of various dynamics of identity and power. As both vehicles and artifacts of rhetoric, bodies hold\
the power to reveal, maintain, and disrupt the underlying beliefs, norms, and values of a given culture. This\
course explores the relationship between the body and rhetoric, including how bodies communicate\
rhetorical messages as well as how broader discourses enable, constrain, and define bodies in particular ways.\

RFSS S24 American Cinema in the 1990s: Historical Context for Contemporary Issues\
The 1990s are widely regarded as the decade when independent features came to dominate American\
cinema, but many of the issues that are prominent in today\'92s social, cultural, and political landscape were\
also preoccupying filmmakers in the 1990s. Films made in this decade tackled environmental concerns, racial\
politics, gender equality, sexual harassment, technological innovations, sexual violence, and terrorism. These\
socially-minded themes were often complemented by an aesthetic daring that explored the possibilities of the\
medium. This course looks at a series of films from the 1990s to appreciate the formal possibilities of\
cinematic storytelling and historically contextualize various issues of the 2010s. Prerequisite(s): one course in\
rhetoric, film, and screen studies.\

Sociology\
Professors Duina and Kane; Associate Professors Rocque (chair) and Taylor; Assistant Professor Medford; Visiting\
Assistant Professor Reshetnikov\
The curriculum in sociology is designed to introduce students to the sociological perspective, which explores\
social structures, cultural factors, and other variables that intersect with, and influence, individual lives.\
Courses address a wide range of social phenomena, from patterns of everyday interaction to social and\
political revolutions. Sociology as a discipline focuses on recognizing and analyzing social determinants that\
shape our lives. That focus offers a unique potential not only for understanding society, but also for social\
action and social change.\
The curriculum offers a variety of 100- and 200-level courses introducing sociology and many of the specific\
topics and issues addressed by sociologists. Most 200-level courses are open to first-year students and have no\
prerequisites. The core courses for the major also begin at the 200 level. These core courses focus on\
developing the skills and tools necessary for a more advanced application of a sociological perspective,\
preparing students for more advanced course work and thesis research.\
The methods and substantive areas of sociology provide an excellent background for a wide range of careers\
in fields such as government, public policy, law, social research, community work, social activism, health,\
human services, social work, counseling, education, business, human resources, advertising, and market\
research, as well as a strong foundation for graduate study in sociology and a variety of applied or related\
areas including law, criminal justice, social work, business, public policy and public administration, urban\
and community planning, health care administration, public health, education, survey research\
administration, and journalism.\
More information is available on the Sociology department website.\

Courses Taken Outside of Cheltenham\
1. Is it difficult to combine study abroad with the sociology major?\
Because study abroad is highly relevant to the major in sociology, the department tries to work with students\
to make sure they can combine their sociology coursework with study off campus, including Cheltenham Fall\
Semester programs, JSA, and JYA. Many students are able to complete one or two courses that count toward\
the major, if they happen to select an off-campus program that offers courses in sociology or closely-related\
disciplines. But even students wishing to pursue a program emphasizing other kinds of study, in which they\
are not able to count any courses toward the major, usually have little difficulty combining their Cheltenham\
sociology coursework with off-campus study. The remaining FAQs on this list will help you think through\
what you need to take before you study away, as well as what might count toward the major from your offcampus\
study curriculum.\
2. How many courses taken abroad can I count towards my Sociology major?\
One or two courses from a junior semester abroad/off campus may be considered for application toward the\
major as electives, if they are taught in a sociology department or if the Cheltenham Sociology Department\
determines that they are adequately sociological. Students studying off campus for their entire junior year\
may request consideration for a maximum of three electives. Students are not normally granted credit for\
courses taken abroad in meeting the theory, methods, and 300-level requirements for the major.\
3. What sociology courses do I need to complete before I study off-campus during my junior year?\
It is important for students planning to study off-campus to think ahead about how they will complete the\
core courses, methods (Soc. 205) and theory (Soc. 204), since these must be completed prior to the beginning\
of the senior thesis. You must take Soc. 204 and 205 before the end of your junior year, and these courses are\
typically offered only in the winter semester. The Department Chair or any other faculty member will be\
happy to help you with this kind of planning.\
4. Do I need to get my study abroad courses approved by the sociology department before I leave?\
You should consult in advance with the Department Chair about the sociology (or closely related) courses\
you intend to take during your off-campus study. Though the courses will not necessarily be approved\
officially before you leave, as there may be uncertainty about which specific courses will be available to you,\
this consultation will ensure that you are clear about the department\'92s policies for counting courses before\
you make your final selections.\
5. What if my course options or plans change once I am abroad/away?\
You are welcome to e-mail the Department Chair to request consideration of a newly available course or\
some other change, and/or to seek advice about potential courses.\
6. How do I finalize approval of my courses?\
Cheltenham College 2024-2025 Catalog\
768\
Return to Table of Contents\
Once you return from your off-campus study and your courses are approved for Cheltenham credit by the Center\
for Global Education, then you can meet with the Department Chair again to finalize the application of\
those credits to the major in sociology.\
7. What off-campus study programs do Cheltenham sociology students most often select?\
There are a wide variety of off-campus programs previous sociology students have found particularly\
beneficial. We encourage you to review the various programs available in terms of your own interests and\
educational goals, so you should feel free to begin by reviewing the wealth of information on off-campus\
study available in the Center for Global Education. Their materials include evaluations from previous Cheltenham\
students who have participated in each approved program, and you may want to note particularly those\
completed by sociology majors. In addition, Department faculty will be glad to consult with you regarding\
the programs of interest to you, and help you determine whether they include any courses that might count\
toward the major. If you have particular interests within sociology that are not fully covered within the\
Department, we can help you find a program in which you can explore those interests more fully. But\
especially for students planning to study off-campus for just one semester, we encourage you to select an offcampus\
study opportunity that you want, without feeling constrained by the requirements of the major.\
Short Term Courses\
One Short Term sociology course and one independent study in sociology may also be taken to fulfill the\
major, but neither of these can count as one of the two 300-level courses.\
Pass/Fail Policy\
Pass/Fail grading may not be elected for courses applied toward the major.\

SOC 217 Correcting and Controlling Behavior: A Sociological Perspective on Corrections and Social\
Control\
Many Americans have had contact with the criminal justice system, from police stops to incarceration or\
probation, components of our corrections systems, which, broadly speaking, attempt both to punish\
criminal behavior and change it. Yet we have all been subject to more informal systems of corrections and\
social control, from being grounded to being admonished by a teacher. This course provides a broad\
overview of sociological perspectives on social control in general and criminal justice corrections in\
particular. Topics include the origins, forms, and functions of social control; theories of punishment; the\
history of criminal justice corrections; modern challenges within corrections systems; mass incarceration;\
alternative forms of sanctions; and treatment of offenders. The course also considers research issues faced by\
corrections practitioners, including projects with community partners whose work involves correcting\
behavior. Recommended background: SOC 211.\

articulations of immigration processes in the United States.\

Most, if not all, economic activity-whether it takes place at the level of individuals, organizations, or marketsrequires\
rules, norms, and institutions. Efficiency alone cannot account for the existence and nature of those\
rules, norms, and institutions. Beliefs, values, power structures, perceptions of self-interest, political\
structures, history, and numerous additional factors hold explanatory potential as well. This course\
investigates these factors. In the process, students explore some of the most important theoretical frameworks\
in sociology and politics such as rational choice theory, historical institutionalism and statist theory, and\
some key topics in sociology such as international development.\

Can political violence can ever be ethically justified? Students consider the theoretical and ethical debates\
that surround this question in the context of Black uprisings. This seminar traces major episodes of Black\
rebellion in the United States from the beginning of the African slave trade to the contemporary Black Lives\
Matter Movement moment. Students develop a nuanced understanding of how Black insurgents have\

EUSO 312 Populism in the Age of Globalization\
Populist movements and parties have gained power and prominence in recent years. Often defying\
traditional left-right distinctions, they have in many cases adopted anti-globalization, nationalist or nativist,\
and anti-elitist positions. They have enjoyed electoral and other successes in Europe, Latin America, North\
America, Asia, and Africa. This seminar examines the causes of their rise, nature of their rhetoric and\
policies, and profound impact on cultural, political, economic, and other social processes and dynamics.\

behind space and place. Students distinguish between these similar concepts while exploring the impact they\
may have on an individual. Next, students are introduced to sociological literature that demonstrates the\
impact that physical places can have on individual outcomes. This section of the course examines\
neighborhood characteristics, zoning, transit, public investment, and social infrastructure. The second half of\
the course introduces students to basic geographic information system (GIS) techniques using R to map\
physical locations.\

In this seminar, students examine crime and deviance over the life of individuals, how behavior changes, and\
the role of social institutions and relationships in affecting life outcomes.Why and how do people begin\
engaging in crime and deviance? Why do some people engage at high rates while others only dabble in\
minor crime? How and why do people eventually stop engaging in crime altogether? Students select a\
particular issue early in the semester to study in detail, resulting in an empirical or analytical project. The\
goal is not only to fully understand life-course criminology research, but also to advance this work in new\
and innovative ways. Prerequisite(s): SOC 204 and 205. Recommended background: SOC 101.\

at one time and place. Do people who start committing crimes early in the life end up trapped in a life of\
crime? Do the elderly engage in deviance? How can a career criminal ever stop offending? Students select a\

This course examines the family as a social institution and personal family stories, with attention to structural\
inequalities and their intersections with individual lives. Course materials include sociological memoir,\
qualitative research on family experiences, engagement with local initiatives related to families in the city,\
and a range of story-telling media like documentaries, podcasts, and other creative work. Students\
explore these topics and materials in the context of dynamics of privilege, exclusion, and marginalization,\
including systemic racism, capitalism, and inequalities of gender, sexuality, (dis)ability, nationality, and\
citizenship. Throughout the course, students also construct sociological analyses of their own families, with a\

Sex is a sociological conundrum. It is deeply culturally scripted but also inescapably embodied and\
individual. Sex can be the perfect win-win proposition, providing gratuitous pleasure and social bonding. Yet\
sex can also be a disaster, bringing unwanted physical consequences and the most profound humiliation.\
This course explores a wide variety of work on sex from sociology and neighboring disciplines, including\
contemporary biological and psychological knowledge about human sex. The goal is a thoroughgoing and\
humane rethinking of taken-for-granted perspectives on this delightful and disturbing aspect of human\
experience.\

Return to Table of Contents\
sociological theories of the production, consumption, and proliferation of art. Some of the questions we will\
answer include: why does a subjective product sell for millions, how do we determine when art is obscene,\
and what purpose does art serve? Students will be tasked with establishing sociological connections to art.\
Issues such as inequality can be seen in paintings, songs, films, and any other artistic medium. Art does not\
occur in a vacuum, and students will unpack that relationship in full. The final portion of this class will task\
students with developing their own artistic work that demonstrates sociological importance. Students are not\
expected to demonstrate technical skills, but instead to connect course concepts to the practice of making art.\

SOC S25 Consciousness in Sociology Theory\
The concept of "consciousness" appears in the works of all major classical sociological figures. Curiously, to\
date, no systematic effort exists that provides a comparative assessment of its use. This course focuses on five\
foundational theorists-Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Mead, and Du Bois-and considers the extent to which\
human consciousness is central to their theories, the proposed "objects" of such consciousness, the existence\
of both individual and shared consciousnesses, and whether those consciousnesses exist in conflict or\
harmony with each other. The analysis will improve students' understanding of classical sociological\
thought. A consideration of consciousness in contemporary theories also informs the course. The course\
focuses mostly on textual analysis, but students are also expected to carry out investigations outside the\
classroom and around campus.\

produced by the intersection of individual lives with institutions such as family, health care, and the\
workplace. The course applies the theoretical perspectives and methodological techniques of life-course\
sociology to an exploration of life trajectories and the meanings of age.\

spans millennia and is practiced all over the world, connections must be made with and between multiple\
cultures and traditions. To make things by making connections is to learn about process, self-discipline,\
collaboration, and critical thinking. To that end, the curriculum strikes a balance among artistic training,\
technical skills, and the study of literature and history. Majors are prepared for graduate work in the\
humanities, for further professional training, or for initial steps toward a career in the field.\
In conjunction with academic work, the department annually produces more than a dozen plays, dance\
concerts, and other performance events in its three theaters. These involve large numbers of students, both\
majors and nonmajors. The department invites all members of the community to join in the creation of\
these events.\
More information on the theater curriculum is available on the Theater website.\
Dance\
The Department of Theater and Dance offers a major and a minor in dance. Integrating both theory and\
practice within the framework of a liberal arts education, the curriculum develops an understanding of art\
and culture and the positionality of individuals through the lens of dance. With a variety of performing,\
choreographic, contextual, and individualized study opportunities, the dance program nurtures artistic\
independence, interdisciplinarity, and above all, a strong supportive community.\
More information on the dance curriculum is available on the Dance website.\

DANC 105 Introduction to Performance Studies\
In this course students explore the question "what is performance?" and how this informs their\
understanding of an increasingly mediated and globalized world. They examine the broad spectrum of\
performance in its many forms including theater, dance, visual art, performance art, everyday life, folklore,\
rituals and celebrations, and protests as well as the processes of each. Students apply readings on performance\
theory to performance events and sites on campus and beyond. In addition, they engage in an in-depth\
exploration of both global and intercultural performances and the growing international importance of this\
field.\

devising practices, theories, and politics through the exploration of how performance companies work in this\
generative space, and explore devising techniques to practice these methodologies in action.\

CMDN 213 The Chorus Ancient and Modern: Forms of Communal Performance and the Body Politic\
This course investigates the chorus, a particular form of group perfomance developed in ancient Greece. It\
begins by exploring how the ancient chorus both praised and questioned the political systems that facilitated\
it before considering how choral performance in the modern period has been an effective tool for\
propaganda, riot, and revolt. Alongside works by ancient Greek poets, students look at a range of modern\
performance genres such as opera, ballet, sporting ceremonies, Broadway musicals, and flash mobs. Students\
also gain experience of communal performance themselves through participation in a series of practical\
movement and singing workshops. Recommended background: course work in classical and medieval\
studies, dance, music, or theater.\

THEA 223 Dramaturgy: An Introduction\
A dramaturg contributes a wide variety of theatrical knowledge\'97literary, historical, critical, and practical\'97\
to the process of producing a play. The dramaturg\'92s function in a theater company is to ask and answer\
questions, small and large, about everything from the meaning of a single word in a text, to the meanings of\
the text as a whole. The dramaturg must also understand the requirements of production such as acting,\
directing, and design. And the dramaturg must be able to communicate this knowledge and understanding\
in clear written form to the artists producing the play and to the audiences watching it.\

THEA 306 Prison, Abolition, and the Arts\
This seminar explores the history and philosophy of incarceration, rehabilitation, and abolition, with a focus\
on the role that performance and theater have played in prisons. Students examine institutions and\
organizations that aim to reform carceral systems through art and discuss the efficacy of transformational arts\
programming. They read plays that articulate experiences surrounding mass incarceration, systemic\
oppression, and the experience of solitary confinement, and learn about work ranging from poetry to\
community organizing to paintings from incarcerated or formerly incarcerated artists. They also study\
methods of producing theater for social justice and the ethics of conducting ethnographic research. Authors\
include Michelle Alexander, Eric Berryman and The Wooster Group, Angela Davis, George Jackson, Joy\
James, Suzan-Lori Parks, Anna Deavere Smith, Sophie Treadwell, Malcolm X, and August Wilson.\

THEA S20 Telling the Truth: Documentary Theater Theory and Practice\
Documentary theater is a genre of theater making that gathers interviews from real people, assembles them\
into a piece of performance, and renders them, verbatim (word-for-word), for an audience. Typically\
developed in response to a recent event or contemporary issue, famous works of documentary theater in the\
past few decades have probed the murder of Matthew Shepherd (The Laramie Project), exonerated death row\
inmates (The Exonerated), and the 1992 LA Riots (Twilight Los Angeles, 1992). Using the work and methods\
of playwright, performer, and activist Anna Deveare Smith, students delve into her body of work, exploring\
the impact of both her process and her performed work. Students deploy key points of her process toward\
the development of their own documentary theater pieces, based on events and issues relevant to our\
community in a practical exploration of the intersection of art making and activism.\

THEA S33 Central European Theater and Politics\
A study of Hungarian and Czech history, politics, and theater since about 1945. Our focus is on the impact\

1956. Other seminal events bearing on this study are the Prague Spring of 1968, the collapse of the Soviet\
bloc in 1989, and the subsequent rebuilding of politics and culture in the region up until today. In\
conjunction with our study of history, politics, and drama, students read an array of secondary sources on the\
social and cultural history of post-war Central Europe. Classes will be conducted as discussions, led by the\
Cheltenham instructors and Hungarian, Czech, and other Central European artists and scholars. Students maintain\
a journal describing and analyzing the plays, readings and other academic materials studied. Recommended\
